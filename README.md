# Dungeon Crawler Carl RPG for Foundry VTT

I'm just vibe coding my way to a placeholder until the real deal comes out.  This is in no way officially associated with the DCC brand, nor is it intended to be a replacement for the official game system once it is released.

Questions or concerns contact me @ shinierball via gmail or maybe discord or whatever the cool kids use these days.

## Features

- Hopefully the AI keeps this in sync reasonably with reality, but code changes so fast these days! Odds that this accurately reflects the rules are probably close to zero, but I'm committed to the process of telling the AI to do better!

- **CarlRPG 3.2.7 Rank Break Critical Milestones, Selectable Ranks 1–20 & Unified Trigger Tags**:
  - **Consolidated Rank Break Critical Multipliers**: Critical multipliers are moved directly into milestone breaks (`critMultiplier`, defaulting to 1), removing the redundant separate `critMultiplierR5` and `critMultiplierR15` inputs. Any milestone break (Rank 10, Rank 17, Rank 20, etc.) can now configure critical hit damage multipliers (2x, 4x, 6x, 8x).
  - **Selectable Milestone Ranks (1–20 Inclusive)**: Freed from the hardcoded Ranks 5, 10, 15, 20 convention, each milestone break card now features a selectable `Rank` dropdown (1–20). This accommodates early rank perks (Ranks 1–4), intermediate milestones (Rank 10, Rank 12), and end-game power increases (Ranks 16–20) for both canon and homebrew content.
  - **Unified Tag System Triggers**: Registered `trigger` namespace with `trigger.crit`, `trigger.fumble`, and `trigger.on_hit` tags. Automatically derives trigger tags from rank break multipliers, fumble debuffs, and on-hit debuff configurations.
  - **Dynamic Actor Combat Evaluation**: Actor damage calculations dynamically sort milestones by configured rank threshold ascending, ensuring critical damage multipliers and on-hit debuffs trigger as soon as the crawler's rank reaches the milestone, with full legacy fallback support.

- **CarlRPG 3.2.6 Data-Driven Healing, HoT, Cleansing & Armor-Piercing (DR Bypass) Subsystems**:
  - **Data-Driven Healing, HoT & Cleansing**: Spells and Skills support full data-driven health bar healing (`barsFormula` supporting static counts or stat-scaled formulas like `1 + con`), target filtering (`self`, `allies`, `area`), Heal Over Time (`isHoT`, `hotRounds`), and debuff cleansing (`cleanseDebuffs`). Includes milestone rank break scaling (extra bars and debuff cleanses at Ranks 5, 10, 15, 20) and automated chat cards with 1-click token healing application buttons (`.dcc-apply-healing-btn`, `.dcc-apply-hot-btn`, `.dcc-cleanse-debuff-btn`).
  - **Armor-Piercing / Ignore DR Subsystem**: Weapons, attacks, spells, techniques, and milestone rank breaks (e.g. *Icicles* and *Paladin's Smite* Rank 15) feature structured `ignoreDR` / `isArmorPiercing` attributes. Attack and damage cards display vivid `[ARMOR-PIERCING]` badges and automatically route damage through `DCCCombatMetrics.applyDamageToTarget({ ignoreDR: true })`, bypassing target DR while strictly obeying CarlRPG full damage bar absorption rules.
  - **Progressive Disclosure UI Modules**: Collapsible `<details class="dcc-collapsible-block">` modules for *Healing, Regeneration & Cleansing Configuration* and quick *Armor-Piercing* toggles maintain clean, uncluttered sheets while allowing players and GMs to compose custom healing and piercing abilities.

- **CarlRPG 3.2.4 Tag Manager High-Contrast Checkbox Styling & Dark Mode Contrast Fixes**:
  - **Eliminated Row Background Inversion**: Removed the white background inversion when checking assigned tags (`isAssigned`), completely preventing white-on-white text illegibility in dark mode. Table rows retain a clean, consistent background across themes.
  - **High-Contrast Checkbox Styling**: Checkboxes in the Tag Manager are scaled to `18px x 18px` with a crisp 2px high-contrast outline (`outline: 2px solid #ffffff !important` in dark mode, `2px solid #333` in light mode) and vivid DCC Red fill (`accent-color: #c0392b` / `#e74c3c`), making checkboxes immediately visible and clear whether checked or unchecked.
  - **Complete Dark Mode Theme Contrast**: Styled tag IDs (`#5dade2`), descriptions (`#9ca3af`), target banners (`#1a2733`), search inputs, and namespace badges with high contrast.

- **CarlRPG 3.2.3 Universal Progressive Disclosure Item Architecture & Single-Engine Gear Auras**:
  - **Progressive Disclosure Across All Item Sheets**: Replaced massive, overwhelming item configuration pages with collapsible `<details class="dcc-collapsible-block">` modules for Spells, Attacks, Gear, and Skills. Sheets stay clean and focused for basic item creation, while rich sub-systems (Auras, AoE Geometry, Rank Breaks, Weapon Proficiencies, Scaling Damage Parts, Techniques, and Debuffs) expand with one click.
  - **State-Aware Automatic Expansion**: Sheets detect configured data on an item (`hasAuraConfigured`, `hasDamageModifiersConfigured`, `hasRankBreaksConfigured`, etc.) and automatically display active sections expanded with clear `[CONFIGURED]` gold status badges.
  - **Single-Engine Gear Auras**: Gear items (amulets, cloaks, shields, armor) share the exact same unified `area` and `tempBars` schemas as spells, enabling passive or activated auras through the same unified game engine without duplicate code.

- **CarlRPG 3.2.2 Pathfinder 2e-Style Effects Panel, User-Created Custom Auras & Multi-Effect Scaling Engine**:
  - **Pathfinder 2e-Style Active Effects & Auras Panel**: Docked along the right canvas edge immediately to the left of Foundry's right navigation sidebar (`#sidebar`). Displays square icon badges with duration countdown pills (`2r`, `10m`, `∞`), distinguishing Aura Emitters (gold pulse) from Protected Allies (cyan shield), buffs (green), and debuffs (red). Includes interactive flyout cards with a 1-click **Dismiss Aura** button.
  - **User-Creatable Custom Auras**: Any custom spell or item created by a user (e.g. "Cold Stuff Aura", "Noxious Spore Cloud", "Storm Shield") runs entirely through data-driven geometry and outcome configurations with zero hardcoding. Supports allied protection (temp bars, damage absorption) and enemy hazards (periodic damage, debuffs).

- **CarlRPG 3.2.1 Hot Stuff Aura Burst Radius Fix, Ally Bonus Health Bars & Universal Temp Bar Absorption**:
  - **Accurate Burst Radius Scaling**: Base burst radius for Hot Stuff Aura is strictly 5ft at Rank 1 (preventing erroneous 20ft template placement), expanding to 10ft at Rank 10 and 20ft cumulative at Rank 15.
  - **Burst Radius Ally Bonus Bars**: Activating the aura applies bonus health bar slots (CHA Mod slots) to all allies (crawlers, pets, friendly tokens) within the burst radius, while excluding hostiles. Dismissing or expiring the aura cleanly clears temporary health bars from caster and all protected allies.
  - **Universal Damage Absorption**: Temporary health bars absorb incoming damage slot-by-slot before permanent HP can be harmed, whether damage originates from attack chat cards (`applyDamage()`), direct token HUD bar editing, or actor updates.
  - **Clear Sheet & Combat Tracker Display**: Interactive gold shield badges display active bonus bars (`🛡️ +X Bars (Y HP)`) in the numeric HP header row of the character sheet and beside combatant health bars in the Combat Tracker.

- **CarlRPG 3.2.0 Tag-Driven Effects Engine, Structured Item Grants & Migration Subsystem**:
  - **Tag-Driven Consumables & Resource Effects**: Replaced hardcoded item name checks (`itemName.includes('mana potion')`) with data-driven structured outcomes tagged with exact tags (`action.restore`, `resource.mana`, `action.heal`, `resource.hp-bars`). Consumable mana potions and health potions now resolve outcomes dynamically through `resolveSingleOutcome()`, providing interactive `.dcc-apply-mana-btn` chat cards for 1-click crawler mana restoration.
  - **Zero-Regex Damage Reductions**: Replaced brittle description regex parsing (`desc.match(/(\d+)%/)`) with exact element tag matching via `damageTypeToElement()` and debuffs/buffs tagged with `element.*`. Evaluates structured `reductionPercent` and `reductionFlat` properties directly.
  - **Structured Item Grants on Gear, Buffs, and Items (`system.grants`)**: Gear, loot, and buffs support structured grants (`stat`, `dr`, `evade`, `skill`, `spell`, `tag_bonus`). Equipped gear and active buffs dynamically apply stat bonuses, DR, evade, granted skills, and granted spells (with ranks and cooldown rules) to actor sheets, plus tag query bonuses (e.g. `+2 to all element.fire spells`).
  - **Comprehensive 3.2.0 World & Compendium Item Migration**: Automated migration pipeline (`migrateWorld320()`) updates all existing items in the world and compendium packs to structured outcomes and structured grants with zero data loss. All compendium packs rebuilt to version 3.2.0.

- **CarlRPG 3.1.0 Auras, Temporary Health Bars, Areas of Effect & Combat Round Durations**:
  - **Aura & Extensible AoE Delivery**: Fully modular auras scaling dynamically with caster rank breaks and attributes (e.g. *Hot Stuff Aura* base 5ft radius, expanding to 10ft at Rank 10 and 15ft at Rank 15). Structured AoE delivery supports placed templates (*Fireball*), persistent auras, customizable shapes (circle, cone, ray, rect), target filters (`allies`, `enemies`, `all`, `self`), and emission properties (light/darkness). 1-click toggling from the Hotlist, character sheet, or chat card with interactive `Dismiss Aura` and `Place Area of Effect` buttons.
  - **Temporary Health Bars Pipeline**: Implemented first-absorption temporary health bars (`hp.tempBars`). Temporary HP acts as additional health bar slots consumed slot-by-slot before permanent HP can be touched. Full depletion decrements slot counts, with spillover penetrating to regular health bars under DCC full-bar rules. Interactive gold shield slot indicators render directly on crawler sheets above the core health bar.
  - **Combat Round Duration Clock**: Automated round-based duration tracking (each combat round = 10 seconds) on `DCCCombat.nextRound()`. Effects with round durations decrement each turn, cleanly expiring effects, resetting temporary health bars, and posting Dungeon AI notification cards to the chat log upon completion.
  - **Tag Taxonomy Extensions**: Expanded tag taxonomy with `delivery.*`, `duration.*`, `target.*`, `shape.*`, and `rule.*` namespaces, automatically deriving tags from item configurations without string parsing or regular expressions.

- **CarlRPG 3.0.2 Tag System Guide, Accurate To-Hit Formulas & Journals Pack**:
  - **In-Game Tag System & Content Creation Guide (`packs/journals`, `carl.openTagGuide()`)**: Official 7-chapter in-game reference manual covering tag taxonomy across 12 namespaces, item creation, secondary skills (*Aiming* disadvantage offset and damage tiers), favored spell +1 MP calculations, structured grants (`system.grants`), and DCC rule-breaking principles. Auto-populates in world journals via `ensureTagSystemJournal()` and includes a 1-click **📖 Tag Guide** button in the Tag Manager.
  - **Accurate To-Hit Formula Character Sheet Display**: Attack roll buttons on the character sheet evaluate and display the exact to-hit formula (`1d20 + 14` when trained, `2d20kl + 4` when untrained or at disadvantage, incorporating Aiming rank offsets) with comprehensive breakdown tooltips. Custom-named weapons (e.g. *Boom Stick*) cleanly resolve associated skill ranks without reverting to 0.

- **CarlRPG 3.0.1 Unified Tagging System & Tag Taxonomy Engine**:
  - **Namespaced Tag IDs**: Fully data-driven keyword architecture covering 10 namespaces (`kind.*`, `action.*`, `element.*`, `archetype.*`, `favored.*`, `weapon.*`, `weaponClass.*`, `weaponProp.*`, `skillGroup.*`, `technique.*`, `rule.*`, `id.*`, and `custom.*`). Zero regex matching or string heuristics across the game engine.
  - **TagQuery Engine**: Structured queries (`matchesTagQuery(tags, query)`) evaluating string, array, or `{ all, any, none }` Boolean queries with automatic reference expansion (`expandTagReferences`).
  - **High-Performance Tag Index Service**: In-memory `TagIndex` singleton (`game.dcc.tags`) indexing world items and compendiums with live mutation hooks (`createItem`, `updateItem`, `deleteItem`).
  - **Structured Class & Race Grants**: Complete `system.grants` specification across all 53 classes and 30 races cleanly applying stat boosts, skills, spells, choices, and archetype skill modifiers (e.g., Boring Ol' Mage -3 to Dex/Str skills floored at 1).
  - **Favored Spell Mechanics**: Automatic caster archetype evaluation via `favored.*` tags, imposing +1 MP penalty for non-favored class casters while exempting classless crawlers and pets per official DCC rules.
  - **Interactive Tag Manager App & Sheet Editor**: Full visual browser (`DCCTagManager`) with namespace filtering, usage counts, custom tag creation, and item sheet tag badges with autocomplete and 1-click removal. Directly binds to item sheets when launched from items, with live tag checkboxes and auto-apply on creation.
  - **Additive Weapon Damage & Unequipped Filtering**: Weapons with associated skills cleanly resolve primary combat weapon skills (e.g. *Shotgun*) vs auxiliary passive skills (*Aiming*), combining weapon item damage parts (e.g. *Boom Stick* 1d6 Fire) additively with skill damage (3d10 Piercing), passive bonuses (3d4), and rank dice. Weapon attacks require an equipped weapon (`rule.requires-weapon`), preventing unequipped weapons from cluttering attack sheets.

- **Item Idempotence, Crawler Cross-Scene Persistence & Compendium Synchronization**:
  - **Discrete Non-Consumable Items**: Gear, weapons, and armor exist as discrete, unique entries per acquisition so each can be equipped, modified, and tracked independently. Consumable loot (e.g. potions) stacks quantity.
  - **Crawler Cross-Scene Persistence**: Crawlers and pets are singular, global entities. Editing a crawler on any scene automatically updates the world actor, keeping all scenes and tokens perfectly synchronized into the future.
  - **Globally Unique Spells (Idempotence)**: Spells on an actor are globally unique. Adding or dropping an existing spell merges rank to the highest rank without creating duplicate spellbook entries.
  - **Compendium-to-World Sync Engine**: Modifying any Spell, Gear, Loot, Class, Race, Buff, Debuff, or Skill in a Compendium pack automatically propagates updates to every actor and world item in the campaign, ensuring changes are reflected for all users while preserving player progression (invested ranks, equipped status, quantity, and training hours).

- **Pathfinder 2e-Style Active Effects & Auras Panel**:
  - **Docked Live-Play HUD**: Displays a vertical column of status badges immediately to the left of Foundry's right navigation sidebar (`#sidebar`), dynamically adjusting when the sidebar collapses or expands.
  - **Token & Character Binding**: Dynamically tracks the currently controlled token on the canvas, falling back to the player's assigned Crawler (`game.user.character`) if no token is selected.
  - **Aura Emitters vs. Protected Receivers**: Distinguishes aura emitters (gold pulsing flame ring with `[AURA EMITTER]` badge) from allies protected within burst radius (cyan shield border with `[AURA PROTECTED]` badge), as well as debuffs and buffs.
  - **Interactive Popover Flyouts**: Clicking an effect badge reveals a detailed card with source caster name, remaining rounds/seconds countdown, exact benefits (+X temporary health bars, elemental absorption, periodic damage), and 1-click **Dismiss Aura** controls for owners and GMs.
- **User-Creatable Custom Auras & Multi-Effect Scaling Engine**:
  - **Zero Hardcoded Names**: All aura mechanics operate 100% data-driven through item geometry and outcome definitions. Users can create custom spells, magical gear, or buffs (e.g. *Cold Stuff Aura*, *Noxious Spore Cloud*, *Storm Shield*) that emit custom auras without requiring code modifications.
  - **Progressive Disclosure UI**: The Spell Sheet features a collapsible `<details>` block for **AURA & AREA OF EFFECT CONFIGURATION**, remaining compact and unobtrusive until activated.
  - **Multi-Effect Configuration**: Simultaneous support for allied benefits (temporary health bars, elemental damage absorption) and enemy hazards (periodic damage formula, element, on-enter/tick debuff infliction).
  - **Cumulative Rank Scaling**: Configurable radius bonuses and upgraded temporary health bars across Rank 5, 10, 15, and 20 milestone cards.
- **Enforced Number of Hands & Limbs Subsystem**:
  - **Physiology & Limbs Tracking**: Full support for varying creature anatomies including standard humanoids (2 arms, 2 legs, 2 hands), quadrupeds (4 legs, 0 hands), and centaurs (4 legs, 2 arms, 2 hands).
  - **Wielding Hand Tracking**: Weapons and gear consume hands according to their wield mode (`one_handed` = 1, `two_handed` = 2, versatile `two_handed_disadv_1h` = 1 or 2) or explicit `handsRequired`. Non-hand gear (torso armor, helmets, boots) consumes 0 hands.
  - **Dynamic Buff & Debuff Modifications**: Traumatic injuries, severed limbs, mutations, and cybernetic prosthetics modify effective limbs (`maxArms`, `maxLegs`, `maxHands`) via structured `limbModifiers` or automatic canonical condition fallbacks (*Severed Hand*, *Amputated Arm*, *Extra Arms*, *Prosthetic Arm*).
  - **Warning Banners & Visual Indicators**: High-contrast warning banners display on Page 1 (Attacks header) and Page 4 (Inventory) when `usedHands > maxHands`, alerting players and GMs without arbitrarily blocking action.
  - **GM-Only Security**: Base limb counts are strictly editable by Game Masters, with server-side payload stripping preventing non-GM players from altering limb values.

- **Unified Global Item Creation & Data-Driven Associations**:
  - **Unified Editor Interface**: The Item Directory `Create Item` button, Item Manager, Skill Manager, and Spell Manager all launch the unified `DCCItemSheet` (Item Builder) editor immediately for all game objects (Weapons, Gear, Spells, Skills, Classes, Races, Buffs, Debuffs, Loot).
  - **Data-Driven Weapon & Skill Associations**: Replaced raw comma-separated text fields with tag pill badges, available-skill dropdown pickers, and single-click "⚡ Auto-Suggest Skills" and "⚡ Auto-Suggest Techniques" actions powered by `weapon-associations.mjs` and skill `appliesTo` metadata without regex (GEMINI.md Rule 0).
  - **Default 1x Critical Hit Multipliers**: Critical hit damage multipliers default to 1x across all ranks for newly created items, skills, and spells, with full GM adjustability on item sheets.
  - **Gold Value Permission Security**: Item value fields are strictly editable by Game Masters, rendering disabled/read-only for non-GM players and stripping client-side edits during sheet submission.

- **6-Tab Modern Character Sheet**: Recreates the official DCC RPG character sheet with modern UX improvements, consolidated workflows, and full PDF export compatibility:
  - **Tab 1 (Core & Combat)**: Character details with dynamic **Race and Class selection dropdowns** (categorized by Earth/Alien heritage and Archetypes, with automated stat application, Damage Resistance [DR] buffs, walk movement deltas and climb/swim/fly/burrow modes, custom embedded Advantage [Buff] and Disadvantage [Debuff] condition items, granted skill/spell management, creature size scaling, and intelligent reversal preserving non-item skill ranks), fixed-gradient Health Bar anchored across total health bars (10%–100%, 10 of 10 in the green, 1 of 10 in the red without shifting), 5 Core Stats (STR, INT, CON, DEX, CHA), EVADE ($d20 + \text{DEX Mod} + \text{Gear} + \text{Buffs}$), DAMAGE RESISTANCE ($\text{Armor} + \text{Gear} + \text{Buffs}$), Mana, AI Favor & Selectable Creature Size category dropdown (1 Tiny to 8 Gargantuan), Active Debuffs strip with severity chips and 1-click removal, Portrait, External Buff Slots (1–3), ATTACKS table with hybrid physical weapon gear auto-recognition, 1-click equip toggling, expandable Stowed Attacks & Weapons drawer (`Stowed (N)`) with automatic scroll navigation back to the attacks section when toggled, interactive damage application, and the 10-slot combat **Hotlist** (with drag-and-drop item, spell, attack, and skill assignment, quick dropdown selection, smart owned-item duplicate prevention, and 1-click execution for attack rolls, damage, gear toggling, and spellcasting).
- **Dedicated Race & Class Item Sheets**:
  - High-contrast, DCC-themed item sheets for all 30 playable races and 53 classes.
  - Interactive displays with responsive header badges (Heritage, Size, DR Bonus, Movement speeds), granted skills/spells card decks, active Advantage/Disadvantage preview cards, racial perks and traits breakdown, prerequisites alert banners, and lore.
- **Weapon Skill Proficiency & Technique Subsystem (Hybrid Multi-Skill Architecture)**:
  - Extends weapons (`GearDataModel` with `isWeapon: true` and `AttackDataModel`) with `weaponCategory`, `weaponType`, `wieldMode` (`one_handed`, `two_handed`, `two_handed_disadv_1h`), `associatedSkills`, `proficiencyMode` (`highest`, `additive`, `primary_plus_half`), and `optionalEffects`.
  - Full manual item creation interface in Item Sheets (`gear`, `attack`, `skill`) allowing players and GMs to manually create custom weapons, chainsaw skills, techniques, and combat maneuvers without touching JSON.
  - Supports 4-layer dynamic skill matching (explicit associations, weapon type model, weapon group taxonomy via `DCC_WEAPON_GROUP_MAP`, and damage type).
  - Employs Specialization Precedence (`proficiencyMode: "highest"`) to resolve d20 attack bonuses without runaway stacking, while considering the crawler trained if any matching skill has Rank $\ge 1$.
  - Extends `SkillDataModel` with `isTechnique`, `appliesTo`, `techniqueConfig`, `critMultiplierR5` (e.g. 4x), `critMultiplierR15` (e.g. 8x), `fumbleDebuff` (e.g. *Minor Injury* on Nat 1), `onHitDebuff` (e.g. *Bleeding*), and `onHitDebuffMinRank`.
- **4-Tier Rank Break Configurations (Ranks 5, 10, 15, 20) for Skills & Spells**:
  - Both skills (`SkillDataModel`) and spells (`SpellDataModel`) feature dedicated, color-coded Rank Break Configuration panels for **Rank 5, Rank 10, Rank 15, and Rank 20**.
  - At each milestone, creators and GMs can configure:
    - **Additional Damage Dies (`damageDice`)**: Extra base damage dice granted at and above this rank (e.g. `+1d6`, `2d4`), scaling cumulative weapon or spell damage.
    - **Additional Rank Damage Dies (`rankDamageDice`)**: Integer count of additional rank damage dice granted (e.g. `+1` or `+2` rank dice), multiplying the evaluated rank damage die.
    - **Buffs or Resistances (`buffsResistances`)**: Descriptive buffs, stat boosts, or damage resistances unlocked at the milestone.
    - **Target Debuffs (`debuff`)**: A status condition or debuff inflicted on targets upon hit (e.g. *Bleeding*, *Crippled*, *Burned*, *Stunned*), producing 1-click **[ 🩸 Inflict Condition ]** buttons on the chat damage card.
    - **Non-Defined Ability Notes (`notes`)**: Freeform notes documenting custom narrative or mechanical perks not formally parameterized by dice.
  - Completely optional: no effects are required to be tied to any rank break, allowing flexible milestone customization.
- **Universal Color Contrast & Human Readability Design Standard**:
  - Full audit across sheets, edit screens, item editors, dialogs, and popups ensuring high-contrast, human-readable typography conforming to WCAG AA ($\ge 4.5:1$ contrast ratio).
  - Explicit dark text colors (`#111111`) across inputs, textareas, and select elements preventing washed-out text caused by browser or operating system dark mode style overrides.
  - Universal high-contrast input placeholders (`#444444`) on all form fields across actor sheets, item sheets, and manager applications.
  - Replaced low-contrast pastel accents (Rank 5 deep green `#196f3d`, Rank 10 deep navy `#1a5276`, Rank 15 deep purple `#6c3483`, Rank 20 deep brown `#873600`) and replaced washed-out greys and light yellows on light surfaces with high-contrast alternatives.

Both sections span the full width of the sheet, and all buffs and debuffs have been moved to their own dedicated tab to keep inventory strictly physical.
  - **Tab 3 (Skills & Spells)**: Unified abilities and magic center combining combat/utility skills and the character spellbook. Full skills table tracking Base Rank, Gear Bonuses, Weapon Group / Type Bonuses, Boon Bonuses, Modified Rank, and Total Skill, with drag-and-drop custom list reordering and 1-click deletion. Spells section includes mana tracking, quotes, ranges, durations, damage, 4-tier rank break configurations, multi-tiered rank-gated damage scaling (`damageModifiers`), critical milestones (Rank 5 4x, Rank 15 8x), on-hit condition/debuff triggers, fumble backfire warnings, optional metamagic riders, and cast roll cards, backed by both the **DCC Skill Library** and **DCC Spell Library**.
  - **Tab 4 (Conditions & Effects)**: Dedicated status effect center managing character buffs, active effects, debuffs, and negative conditions. Displays severity badges (`Minor`, `Moderate`, `Major`), durations, and 1-click quick-assignment buttons (`[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`) to assign owned buffs directly to Page 1 External Buff slots 1, 2, or 3 (highlighted in vivid green when assigned, with 1-click toggle to unassign), plus direct launch to the Condition & Buff Library.

Supports Earth Heritage (guaranteed Silver Earth Box with Earth Hobby Skill Potion and Earth Class eligibility) vs. Alien Heritage (Galactic Fanbase Popularity perk and Earth Class restriction), standardized creature sizes (Sizes 1–6 with Small/Tiny and Large/Huge size modifier pricing at 3 BP), ability bonus/penalty adjustments, skill/spell ranks, catalog benefits and detriments with soft-limit non-enforcement, canonical preset loading (Cat, Arachnid, Pocket Kuma, etc.), 1-click Item directory saving (`type: 'race'`), JSON export/import, direct Crawler sheet application (setting race, creature size, stat adjustments, and embedding racial items), and **precision focus retention with zero-scroll-jump preservation** across all edits, steppers, and accordion toggles. Accessible from the Items directory sidebar (`[ 🧬 Race Creator Studio ]`) or `window.carl.openRaceCreator()`.
  - **Wizard-Driven Choices in Race & Class Application**: Automatically detects dynamic skill/spell choice perks (e.g. Dwarf Classic crafting choices, reach weapon skills, edged weapon skills, spells of choice) across canonical and custom races/classes. Prompts players with an interactive modal wizard during sheet selection, drag-and-drop, or builder application, offering filtered compendium catalogs plus custom write-in entries. Gracefully cancels without modifying actor state, embeds chosen skills/spells onto the item documents, and fully reverts them upon race or class removal.
  - **Interactive Perks & Detriments Selection & Management**: Automatically extracts perks (benefits) and detriments (drawbacks) from canonical definitions, custom point builders, and embedded items. Prompts players with a modal dialog featuring pre-checked options and write-ins upon application (or builders). Selected traits dynamically generate Advantage/Immunity Buff condition items and Disadvantage/Vulnerability Debuff condition items while recording narrative details. Includes quick-access `[ ⚙️ Perks & Detriments ]` management buttons on Page 1 Core and Tab 5 (Story & Extras) with color-coded trait chips (green perks, red detriments), plus full automated teardown on race or class removal.
  - **Global Runtime Integration**: Exposed via `game.dcc.races`, `game.dcc.classes`, `game.dcc.applications.DCCClassCreatorApp`, and `game.dcc.applications.DCCRaceCreatorApp` for direct script, macro, and builder usage.
- **Mob Actor Type, Monster Statblocks & Compendium**:
  - **Official Mob Compendium (`carl-rpg.mobs`)**: Pre-packaged Actor compendium populated with all **84 mobs, bosses, and rival crawlers** from Page 3 of the official *Game Master's Campaign Toolkit* (`MOBS, BOSSES, AND RIVAL CRAWLERS`). Includes Floor 1 Mobs, Floor 2 Mobs, Threat Appendix additions, Neighborhood Bosses (*Aranaea Magnus*, *Critical Consensus*, *The Bar Render*, *Hide-Hitter Crib Daddy*, *Dread Wizard Grimblegore*, *MisChief*, *Mick Moran*, *Cardium Clam*, *The Hoarder*, *The Juicer*, *Krakaren Clone*, *Ralph the Frenzied Gerbil*), Borough Bosses (*Ball of Swine*, *Stiggy*, *Rakish Werehound Shocker*), City Bosses (*Beloved Mimic*, *Prosperity Prophet*), Janitor Mobs (*Brindle Grub*, *Cow-Tailed Brindle Grub*, *Brindled Vespa*, *Rat Janitor*), and Rival Crawlers (*Bruiser*, *Wise-Guyy*).
  - **Variable Health Bars**: Mobs support variable health bar slots (`hp.bars`, from 1 bar up to 23 bars). Health per bar defaults strictly to the mob's CON modifier (`getDCCStatModifier(CON)`), with support for explicit overrides via `hp.hpPerBar`. Damage resolution removes full bars and ignores excess damage per CarlRPG rules.
  - **Independent Unlinked Scene Tokens**: Placed mob tokens default to `prototypeToken.actorLink: false` and hostile disposition. Each token operates completely independently on scenes.
  - **Auto-Incrementing Sequential Token Naming**: Dropping or pasting tokens on a scene automatically appends sequential numbering (`Goblin 1`, `Goblin 2`, `Goblin 3`).
  - **Unique Mob Attributes & Sheet Display**: Dedicated fields for `Treasure` drops, `XP` defeat rewards, `Classification` (Mob, Janitor Mob, Neighborhood Boss, Borough Boss, City Boss, Crawler), `Creature Type` (Animal, Humanoid, Ooze, Monstrous, etc.), `Floor & Location`, `Source Citation`, `Surprise Difficulty` (e.g. `11+F`), and `Evade Difficulty` (e.g. `12+F` based on $10 + \text{Foe DEX Mod} + \text{Floor Number}$ or mob base $+ F$).
  - **Dynamic Mob Evade DC (Base + F) & Global Floor**: All mobs dynamically compute effective Target Evade DC as $\text{Base} + F$, where $F$ is the active world floor (e.g. `14+F` scales to DC 15 on Floor 1, DC 18 on Floor 4), displayed directly on the mob sheet alongside base values.
  - **Automatic Target Hit Resolution & Non-Crawler Evade Button**:
    - **Active Target Hit Evaluation**: Attack rolls (`rollAttack`) and spell attacks (`rollSpellAttack`) automatically check active targets (`game.user.targets` or roll options) and embed a high-contrast target matrix pill row in chat cards showing `[HIT (+X)]` or `[MISS (-X)]`.
    - **Interactive Evade Button**: Any attack rolled by a non-crawler (mob, boss, hostile NPC) embeds a 1-click **Roll Evade** button in the chat message. Defending crawlers clicking this button immediately roll their Evade action ($d20 + \text{DEX Mod} + \text{Gear} + \text{Buffs}$) against the attack total with instant chat evaluation (`SUCCESSFULLY EVADED!` or `EVADE FAILED — HIT TAKEN!`).
  - **Embedded Loot Items & Combat Sheet Integration**: All mob treasure drops are embedded directly as first-class `loot` items across all 84 entities. Page 1 (Core) features a dedicated **Treasure & Loot Drops** quick-access table with inline quantity editing and direct drag-and-drop to player characters.
  - **Direct Combat Attacks & Tactical Spells**: All mob offensive actions are modeled with authentic DCC mechanics. Physical strikes are configured as `type: "attack"` items with damage dice, stat modifiers, and ranges. Spellcaster mobs (e.g. *Dread Wizard Grimblegore*, *Rat Shaman*, *Goblin Shamanka*, *Prosperity Prophet*, *Mind Horror*) feature full mana pools and dedicated `type: "spell"` items (*Fireball*, *Gloat*, *Rat Swarm Summon*, *Grime Curse*, *Eldritch Blast*, *Coin Barrage*, etc.) with 1-click Cast and Damage buttons directly on Page 1 (Core & Combat).
  - **Foundry VTT v12 Sublevel Hydration**: Pack compilation ensures embedded items are properly indexed in the `actors.items` LevelDB sublevel, guaranteeing seamless hydration of all attacks, spells, and loot when actors are opened or spawned from the compendium.
  - **Mob Lore & AI Announcement Terminal**: Dedicated display card on Page 1 (Core) presenting the visual mob description, the iconic Dungeon AI voice broadcast quote, and special combat mechanics/traits.
- **Fillable Character Sheet PDF Export**:
  - One-click **Save to PDF** export directly into the official 6-page fillable character sheet (`assets/sheet/fillable_character_sheet.pdf`).
  - Populates all 429 AcroForm fields (Core vitals & stats, HP gradient threshold boxes, Evade, DR, Attacks, Hotlist, Equipped Gear, Skills, Inventory, Pet & Mount blocks, Personal Space, Kills, Deity, Racial & Class Abilities, and Sponsors).
  - Includes header window action (`Save to PDF`) and stylized quick-action button on Page 1 for immediate downloading and printing outside of Foundry VTT.
- **Dedicated Interactive Catalog Managers**:
  - **Crawler Character Creator (`DCCCrawlerCreatorApp`)**: Fast matrix character creation terminal accessible right from the Actors directory (`[ ⚔️ New Crawler ]`).

Supports direct discovery of character-owned custom buffs alongside world and compendium effects.
  - **External Buff Slots & Custom Buff Management**: Up to 3 active external buffs on Page 1 (Core) with single-match option selection and strict duplicate prevention (a buff cannot occupy multiple slots at once; assigning to a new slot clears previous assignments and options already in use are disabled). Character-owned custom buffs take precedence over compendium defaults, ensuring custom modifiers (e.g. custom +5 STR) are visually preserved upon reopening the sheet and accurately reflected in derived ability score totals.
- **Combat Performance & AI Awards**: Real-time tracking of net damage applied (factoring in target DR and Temp HP), kills, and tactical skills linked to Foundry's Combat Tracker, plus the **Dungeon AI Award Console** for dispensing Loot Boxes (Bronze through Celestial) and AI Favor.

  - Live party dashboard providing real-time party vitals, health bars, mana, net damage dealt/taken, AI favor, popularity, and untrained checks attempted.
  - **Party Grouping & Tracked Roster Management (West Marches Support)**: Configure crawler party affiliations directly on character sheets or in bulk. In PPSM, untracked crawlers from inactive parties are hidden by default (`trackedOnly: true`). Selecting a named party in the **Party** dropdown immediately tracks all members of that party in the active session and untracks all others (`session.trackedCrawlerIds = memberIds`). Includes the **`+ New Party`** modal dialog to define and name a party with crawler checkbox roster selection and instant session activation, 1-click card tracking toggles (`[Tracked]` / `[Untracked]`), segmented view filters (Tracked Only vs All Crawlers), and the interactive **Manage Roster Modal** (`[Manage Roster]`).
  - Full activity and roll ledger tracking trained skills, untrained checks (with disadvantage), spells, attacks, damage, and DM events.
  - **Customized Add Event Dialog (`promptAddEventDialog`)**: Interactive modal dialog supporting all filter options (Crawler selector, Action/Event Type, Untrained Attempt flag, Roll Formula, Total, d20 die face, Target DC, 7-Tier Outcome selector/auto-calculator, Stat/Resource Delta for Favor/Popularity/Damage, and Notes) with automatic filter alignment so new events are immediately visible.
  - **Real-Time Live Event Synchronization**: Open tracker windows update dynamically without requiring screen refresh or search adjustments when events are manually added, attacks/spells/skills/stats/evade checks are rolled, or combat/environmental damage occurs.
  - **7-Tier Roll Outcome Engine**: Automated outcome classification (Critical Failure, Major Failure, Failure, Near Miss, Success, Major Success, Critical Success) based on exact CarlRPG margin thresholds, with inline DM DC and outcome overrides.

Accessible via the Session Manager header (`[ ⚡ Rapid Import ]`), Ledger toolbar (`[ ⚡ Rapid Batch Import ]`), `window.carl.rapidBatchImport()`, or chat command (`/rapidlog` / `/batchlog`).
    - Intelligently parses raw multi-line shorthand notes or voice transcripts (`DCCRapidTextParser`) to extract crawler, action, roll total, DC, 7-tier outcome, crits, untrained checks, damage dealt/taken, healing done, damage mitigation, killing blows, and recipient notes.
    - Features a live editable preview table, sample loader, and single-click batch commit updating ledger entries and crawler summaries in one transaction.
    - **Instant Chat Command (`/log <shorthand>` / `/rlog <shorthand>`)**: Type rolls directly into the chat prompt during physical play to log events on the fly with zero clicks.
  - **End-of-Session Progression**: Field training opportunities allowing one-click promotion of attempted untrained skills to Rank 1, session XP pool distribution across participating tracked crawlers, Dungeon AI recap card broadcast, and session archiving.

## 🛡️ Foundry V15 Compatibility & Namespacing

CarlRPG is fully prepared for Foundry Virtual Tabletop Version 15:
- **Zero Startup Warnings**: All startup routines, HUD widgets (`DCCFloorClockHUD`, `DCCCrawlerClockHUD`, `DCCCrawlerTokenHUD`), and interactive managers prioritize `foundry.applications.handlebars.renderTemplate` and `foundry.applications.handlebars.loadTemplates`.
- **Namespaced Base Classes**: Core document models (`DCCActor`, `DCCItem`) inherit safely from `foundry.documents.Actor` / `foundry.documents.Item` with fallback to base classes before legacy globals.
- **Document Creation & Drop Serialization**: Background roll tables, macros, and drag-and-drop actions resolve via `foundry.documents.*` and `foundry.applications.ux.TextEditor`.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Code Coverage

The CarlRPG system features a headless automated test harness powered by Node.js built-in test runner (`node:test`). Tests run natively without browser dependencies or heavy bundlers.
