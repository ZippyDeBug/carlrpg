## 3.2.8

### CarlRPG 3.2.8 — Contested / Opposed Spell & Skill Checks, Milestone DC Bonuses & Interactive Chat Resolution

- **Data-Driven Contested & Opposed Check Architecture (`template.json`, `src/models/items/spell-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/skill-model.mjs`)**:
  - Added structured `system.contest` configuration to Spells and Skills: `hasContest` (boolean), `contestType` (`dc` vs `opposed`), `targetStat` (`str`, `dex`, `con`, `int`, `cha`), `targetSkill` (optional opposing skill name), `dcFormula` (default `10 + rank + stat`), `customDC` (override for explicit fixed DCs), `onFailDebuff`, `onFailNotes`, and `onSuccessNotes`.
  - Added milestone rank break upgrades (`contest.dcBonus` and `contest.onFailDebuff`) across milestone breaks, allowing spells and skills (e.g. *Rootfoot*, *Web*, *Taunt*, *Grand Illusion*, *Stealth*) to scale DC difficulty and inflict upgraded debuffs as crawlers progress in rank.
- **Unified Tag System Taxonomy (`src/data/tags.mjs`)**:
  - Registered `contest` namespace in `TAG_NAMESPACES`.
  - Added official contest action and resolution tags to `DCC_TAGS`: `action.contested`, `action.opposed`, `contest.dc`, `contest.opposed`, and stat resistance tags `contest.str`, `contest.dex`, `contest.con`, `contest.int`, `contest.cha`.
  - Automatically derives contest tags in `computeDerivedTags()` based on configured contest types and target defending attributes without brittle string matching.
- **Actor Mechanics & Opposed Resolution Engine (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `DCCActor.prototype.getContestData(item, options)`: evaluates DC formulas (`10 + rank + statMod + dcBonus`), resolves milestone rank break bonuses, and formats contest challenge metadata.
  - Implemented `DCCActor.prototype.renderContestChallengeBlock(item, contestData, initiatorTotal)`: embeds high-contrast interactive challenge UI inside spell and skill chat cards.
  - Implemented `DCCActor.prototype.rollContestResponse(params)`: defender rolls opposed check (using `targetSkill` if owned, falling back to DCC stat modifier check), evaluates success or failure against initiator DC or opposed roll total, outputs result chat card, and embeds 1-click debuff button (`.dcc-apply-debuff-btn`) upon failure.
  - Strict DCC rules adherence: strictly leverages `getDCCStatModifier`, completely avoiding D&D math and negative modifiers.
- **Progressive Disclosure Sheet UI (`templates/items/parts/spell.hbs`, `templates/items/parts/skill.hbs`, `src/sheets/item-sheet.mjs`)**:
  - Added collapsible `<details class="dcc-collapsible-block" {{#if hasContestConfigured}}open{{/if}}>` section for *Contested / Opposed Check Configuration* on Spells and Skills.
  - Integrated `+ Contest DC Bonus` and `Upgraded Fail Debuff` inputs into all milestone break cards.
  - Automatically displays `[CONFIGURED]` gold status badges when active.
- **Interactive Chat Resolution Listener (`src/dcc.mjs`, `styles/dcc.css`)**:
  - Registered chat log event listener for `.dcc-roll-contest-btn` delegating seamlessly to targeted or controlled defender tokens.
  - Styled `.dcc-contested-challenge`, `.dcc-roll-contest-btn`, and `.dcc-contest-result-card` with DCC red accents, high-contrast badges, and clean visual borders.
- **Automated Verification (`tests/contested-opposed-checks.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added dedicated 13-test automated test suite covering schema defaults, tag derivations, DC formulas, milestone upgrades, interactive chat rendering, opposed rolls, and item sheet contexts.
  - Verified 100% test pass rate across all 1,227 unit tests with 0 failures.

## 3.2.7

### CarlRPG 3.2.7 — Rank Break Critical Milestones, Selectable Ranks 1–20 & Unified Trigger Tags

- **Consolidated Critical Multipliers into Rank Break Milestones (`template.json`, `src/models/items/spell-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/skill-model.mjs`)**:
  - Removed redundant `critMultiplierR5` and `critMultiplierR15` separate inputs, consolidating critical multipliers directly into milestone breaks (`critMultiplier`, defaulting to 1).
  - Liberated the milestone system from the hardcoded Ranks 5, 10, 15, 20 convention: each milestone break now features a selectable `rank` dropdown (1–20 inclusive, defaulting to 5, 10, 15, and 20).
  - Any milestone break (e.g. Rank 10, Rank 17, or custom milestone) can now specify critical multipliers (e.g. 4x, 6x, 8x), allowing flexible homebrew and emerging canon progression.
  - Fully backward compatible with existing items still utilizing legacy `critMultiplierR5` and `critMultiplierR15` properties.
- **Unified Tag System Triggers (`src/data/tags.mjs`)**:
  - Registered `trigger` namespace in `TAG_NAMESPACES`.
  - Added official condition trigger tags: `trigger.crit`, `trigger.fumble`, and `trigger.on_hit` to `DCC_TAGS`.
  - Dynamically derives `trigger.crit` from rank break critical multipliers (`critMultiplier > 1`) or legacy properties, `trigger.fumble` from fumble debuffs, and `trigger.on_hit` from on-hit debuff configurations.
- **Actor Mechanics & Combat Routing (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Dynamic rank threshold evaluation: actor rolls (`rollSpellDamage`, `rollAttack`, `getSpellDamageData`) now sort milestone breaks dynamically by `Number(rb.rank)` ascending rather than assuming hardcoded ranks.
  - Custom critical multipliers and debuffs apply as soon as the actor's effective item rank reaches the configured milestone rank.
  - Evaluates matching skill rank milestones when rolling weapon attack damage, routing critical multipliers and on-hit debuffs into chat card action buttons and message flags.
- **Progressive Disclosure UI Updates (`templates/items/parts/spell.hbs`, `templates/items/parts/skill.hbs`, `src/sheets/item-sheet.mjs`)**:
  - Updated Condition Triggers section to point directly to milestone break cards.
  - Added milestone `Rank` dropdown selector (1–20) and `Crit Multiplier` input inside all milestone cards on both Spell and Skill item sheets.
  - Provided `availableRanks: [1, ..., 20]` in sheet context.
- **Automated Verification (`tests/rank-break-critical-milestones.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added unit test suite covering schema defaults, trigger tag derivation, selectable ranks 1–20 evaluation, multiple multiplier hierarchies, weapon attack skill integration, and legacy fallback.
  - Verified all 1,214 tests passing across 219 suites with 0 failures.

## 3.2.6

### CarlRPG 3.2.6 — Data-Driven Healing, Health Bar Restoration, HoT, Cleansing & Armor-Piercing (DR Bypass) Subsystems

- **Data-Driven Healing, HoT & Cleansing Subsystem (`template.json`, `src/models/items/spell-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/skill-model.mjs`)**:
  - Added structured `healing` configuration to Spells and Skills: `hasHealing`, `barsFormula` (supports static integers or stat-scaled formulas like `1 + con`, `int`), `targetFilter` (`self`, `allies`, `area`), `isHoT` (Heal over Time toggle), `hotRounds`, and `cleanseDebuffs` (array of debuff names to cure).
  - Added milestone rank break healing upgrades (`healing.barsBonus` and `healing.cleanseDebuff`) across Ranks 5, 10, 15, and 20.
  - Implemented `DCCActor.prototype.applyHealingBars(bars)` (capped at max HP using strict DCC CON-modifier bar values), `applyHoT({ name, healBars, rounds })`, and `cleanseDebuff(name)` (removes matching debuff item documents or all debuffs).
  - Automated interactive chat cards with `.dcc-heal-effect`, `.dcc-apply-healing-btn`, `.dcc-apply-hot-btn`, and `.dcc-cleanse-debuff-btn` for target token interactions.
- **Armor-Piercing / Ignore Damage Resistance (DR) Mechanics (`template.json`, `src/models/items/attack-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/gear-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/spell-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/skill-model.mjs`)**:
  - Added `ignoreDR: false` toggle to Attacks, Gear (weapons/accessories), and Spells; added `isArmorPiercing: false` to `techniqueConfig` and milestone `rankBreaks` (Ranks 5, 10, 15, 20).
  - Evaluates armor-piercing across weapon gear, active technique skills, weapon skill milestone perks, and spell tags (`action.armor_piercing`, `action.ignore_dr`).
  - Displays prominent `[ARMOR-PIERCING]` badge on chat damage cards and automatically assigns `data-ignore-dr="true"` on the primary `dcc-apply-damage-btn`.
  - Fully integrated with `DCCCombatMetrics.applyDamageToTarget({ ignoreDR: true })` to bypass target's DR while strictly respecting DCC full damage bar absorption rules.
- **Progressive Disclosure Sheet UI (`templates/items/parts/spell.hbs`, `skill.hbs`, `attack.hbs`, `gear.hbs`)**:
  - Collapsible `<details class="dcc-collapsible-block">` for *Healing, Regeneration & Cleansing Configuration* on Spell and Skill sheets.
  - Quick toggle checkbox for *Armor-Piercing (Ignores Target DR)* on Attack, Gear, Spell, and Skill sheets.
- **Data Migrations & Automated Verification (`scripts/migrate-healing-and-armor-piercing.mjs`, `tests/healing-cleansing-mechanics.test.mjs`, `tests/armor-piercing-mechanics.test.mjs`)**:
  - Migrated all 54 canonical spells and 121 canonical skills with structured healing and milestone armor-piercing attributes.
  - Added 25 comprehensive unit tests across two new suites verifying end-to-end healing, cleansing, armor-piercing attack rolls, milestone rank break activations, and DR bypass in combat metrics.
  - 1,198 tests in 213 suites passing with 0 failures.

## 3.2.5

### CarlRPG 3.2.5 — Skill Aura Mechanics & Build Engine Unification

- **Build Engine Unification with Skill Auras (`template.json`, `src/models/items/skill-model.mjs`)**:
  - Unified skill items with the single aura engine, adding identical schemas for `area` (burst/cone/line, radius, mobile/placed origin, target filters, periodic damage, debuffs, element absorption), `tempBars` (temporary health bar grants, formulas, and HP per bar), `durationConfig`, and `active`.
  - Added Rank Break aura milestones (`area.radiusBonus` and `tempBars.hpPerSlot`) across Ranks 5, 10, 15, and 20 milestone cards on skills.
- **Progressive Disclosure Skill Sheet UI (`templates/items/parts/skill.hbs`, `src/sheets/item-sheet.mjs`)**:
  - Added collapsible `<details class="dcc-collapsible-block">` for *Aura & Area of Effect Configuration* with automatic progressive disclosure expansion (`hasAuraConfigured`).
  - Added `+ Radius Bonus (ft)` and `Upgraded Temp HP/Bar` inputs inside Rank 5, 10, 15, and 20 milestone break cards on the skill sheet.
- **Actor Aura Activation, Deactivation & Toggle Pipeline (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/apps/effects-panel.mjs`)**:
  - Updated `activateAura(item)` to resolve modified ranks via `getSkillRank(item.name)` for skills, check `DCC_SKILLS` canonical definitions, and apply rank break bonuses starting from Rank 5.
  - Updated `rollSkill(skillItem)` to detect aura skills (`area.hasArea` or `delivery: 'aura'`), toggling them between active and deactivated states with specialized chat cards and dismiss controls.
  - Updated `DCCEffectsPanel.collectEffects()` to collect active skill auras alongside spells, displaying `[AURA EMITTER]` badges, live durations, burst radiuses, and temp health bar details.
- **Automated Verification (`tests/skill-aura-mechanics.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added comprehensive automated test suite verifying skill data model schema initialization, sheet context preparation, rank scaling, temporary health bar absorption, roll toggle dismissal, and effects panel integration.
  - Verified 1,173 unit tests passing with 0 failures across 201 test suites.

## 3.2.4

### CarlRPG 3.2.4 — Tag Manager High-Contrast Checkbox Styling & Dark Mode Contrast Fixes

- **Tag Manager High-Contrast Checkboxes & Inversion Prevention (`templates/apps/tag-manager.hbs`, `styles/dcc.css`)**:
  - Removed inline `background: #f4fbf7` row style when tags are assigned (`isAssigned`), completely preventing row background turning white and causing white-on-white text illegibility in dark mode.
  - Sized checkboxes to an explicit `18px x 18px` with clear pointer interaction.
  - Added high-contrast checkbox outlines (`outline: 2px solid #333` in light mode, `outline: 2px solid #ffffff !important` in dark mode) and prominent DCC Red accent colors (`accent-color: #c0392b` / `#e74c3c`).
  - Added full dark mode color contrast overrides for tag IDs (`#5dade2`), descriptions (`#9ca3af`), target banners (`#1a2733`), search inputs, and namespace pills.
- **Verification (`tests/tag-manager-ui.test.mjs`)**:
  - Verified absence of row background inversion when tags are assigned.
  - Verified high-contrast checkbox CSS and dark mode outline definitions.
  - All 1,165 unit tests passing with 0 failures across 201 test suites.

## 3.2.3

### CarlRPG 3.2.3 — Universal Progressive Disclosure Item Architecture & Single-Engine Gear Auras

- **Modular Progressive Disclosure Architecture (`templates/items/parts/`, `styles/dcc.css`, `src/sheets/item-sheet.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented collapsible `<details class="dcc-collapsible-block">` modules with smooth chevron animations and dynamic state indicators (`[CONFIGURED]` in gold vs. `[CLICK TO CONFIGURE]` in muted gray).
  - Keeps item sheets compact, readable, and decluttered by default while allowing users to reveal and configure deep subsystem features with a single click:
    - **Spell Sheets (`spell.hbs`)**: Collapsible modules for *Aura & AoE Configuration*, *Condition Triggers & Critical Consequence*, *Spell Damage Modifiers*, and *Rank Break Configurations (Ranks 5, 10, 15, 20)*.
    - **Attack Sheets (`attack.hbs`)**: Collapsible modules for *Weapon Proficiency & Wielding Modes*, *Composite Damage Parts*, and *Optional Effects & Combat Maneuvers*.
    - **Gear Sheets (`gear.hbs`)**: Collapsible modules for *Weapon Proficiency & Wielding Modes*, *Ability Modifiers*, *Skill Modifiers*, *Weapon Damage Parts*, *Gear Aura Emission*, and *Activated Ability & Item Outcomes*.
    - **Skill Sheets (`skill.hbs`)**: Collapsible modules for *Techniques, Conditions & Critical Milestones*, *Rank Break Configurations (Ranks 5, 10, 15, 20)*, and *Attack Damage Modifiers (Scaling / Passive)*.
  - Smart automatic expansion: Sheets intelligently detect configured data on an item (`hasAuraConfigured`, `hasDamageModifiersConfigured`, `hasRankBreaksConfigured`, etc.) and automatically display those sections expanded so existing configurations are immediately visible.
  - Zero form harvesting interference: Native HTML `<details>` guarantees Foundry's `FormDataExtended` collects inputs regardless of collapsed state with zero data loss.
- **Single-Engine Gear Auras (`template.json`, `src/models/items/gear-model.mjs`, `src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Unified gear items (shields, amulets, cloaks, armor) with the exact same `area` and `tempBars` schemas as spells.
  - Leverages the single aura engine in `DCCActor.prototype.activateAura(gearItem)` and `deactivateAura(gearItem)` without duplicating any aura logic or creating separate code paths.
  - Preserved existing `area` and `tempBars` configurations during rank break hydration in `hydrateRankBreaks`.
- **Automated Verification (`tests/progressive-disclosure-sheets.test.mjs`)**:
  - 100% test coverage validating progressive disclosure context calculations across default and configured spells, attacks, gear, and skills.
  - Verified single-engine gear aura activation, temporary health bar granting, and deactivation.
  - Full test suite passing with 1,164 tests across 201 suites and 0 failures.

## 3.2.2

### CarlRPG 3.2.2 — Pathfinder 2e-Style Effects Panel, User-Created Custom Auras & Multi-Effect Scaling Engine

- **Pathfinder 2e-Style Active Effects & Auras Panel (`src/apps/effects-panel.mjs`, `templates/apps/effects-panel.hbs`, `styles/dcc.css`)**:
  - Implemented `DCCEffectsPanel` docked along the right canvas edge immediately to the left of Foundry's right navigation sidebar (`#sidebar`).
  - Automatically binds to the controlled token placeable on the canvas, falling back to `game.user.character` when unselected.
  - Displays square icon badges with high-contrast duration countdown pills (`2r`, `10m`, `∞`).
  - Distinguishes **Aura Emitters** (gold glowing pulse ring and `[AURA EMITTER]` badge) from **Aura Receivers / Protected Allies** (cyan shield border and `[AURA PROTECTED]` badge), as well as debuffs (red border) and buffs (green border).
  - Interactive flyout card popover on click: Displays aura source, full duration text with remaining rounds/seconds, exact granted benefits (bonus health bars, elemental absorption, periodic damage), and a 1-click **Dismiss Aura** button for owners/casters.
  - Automatically updates on token selection (`controlToken`), combat turn/round advance (`updateCombat`), actor updates (`updateActor`), and combat deletion.
- **User-Creatable Custom Auras & Zero-Hardcoding Engine (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/models/items/spell-model.mjs`, `template.json`)**:
  - Removed all hardcoded spell name lookups (`spellItem.name.includes('hot stuff')`) and canonical compendium fallbacks.
  - Any custom spell or item created by a user (e.g. "Cold Stuff Aura", "Noxious Spore Cloud", "Storm Shield") runs entirely through data-driven geometry and outcome configurations.
  - Added multi-effect handling:
    - **Allied Protection**: Temporary health bars (`slotsFormula`, `hpPerSlot`), elemental damage absorption (`absorbElement`).
    - **Enemy Hazards**: Periodic aura damage (`periodicDamageFormula`, `periodicDamageType`), on-enter and tick debuff application (`inflictDebuff`).
  - Added `triggerAuraPeriodicEffects(spellItem)` on `DCCActor` to automatically evaluate and apply periodic damage and conditions to enemies within burst radius.
- **Progressive Disclosure UI for Spells (`templates/items/parts/spell.hbs`)**:
  - Added collapsible `<details>` section **"AURA & AREA OF EFFECT CONFIGURATION"** on the Spell Sheet. Unobtrusive when collapsed (single header line) and automatically opens when `system.area.hasArea` is active.
  - Provides form inputs for shape (burst/cone/line), base radius, origin (caster/placed), target filter (allies/enemies/both), allied protection/temp bars, and enemy hazard periodic damage and debuffs.
  - Added compact `+ Radius Bonus (ft)` and `Upgraded Temp HP/Bar` inputs inside each Rank Break milestone card (Ranks 5, 10, 15, and 20), allowing seamless rank scaling configuration for custom auras.
- **Automated Verification (`tests/effects-panel.test.mjs`, `tests/custom-aura-creation.test.mjs`)**:
  - Verified singleton panel initialization, aura emitter vs. receiver classification, sorting priority (debuffs -> emitters -> receivers -> buffs), and aura dismissal.
  - Verified custom "Cold Stuff Aura" creation from scratch, cumulative radius scaling across Ranks 10 and 15, simultaneous allied cold absorption and enemy periodic damage/debuff, and purely hostile aura execution. All 1,158 tests passing across 201 suites with 0 failures.

## 3.2.1

### CarlRPG 3.2.1 — Hot Stuff Aura Burst Radius Fix, Ally Bonus Health Bars & Universal Temp Bar Damage Absorption

- **Aura Burst Radius Calculation (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/dcc.mjs`, `tests/setup.mjs`)**:
  - Fixed fallback radius bug where unconfigured `sys.area.radius` defaulted to 20ft instead of base 5ft at Rank 1.
  - Implemented cumulative rank progression (+5ft at Rank 10, +10ft at Rank 15 -> Rank 1 = 5ft, Rank 10 = 10ft, Rank 15 = 20ft).
  - Added fallback resolution to canonical compendium spell data (`DCC_SPELLS`) if active world item has incomplete area or temp bar definitions.
- **Burst Radius Ally Bonus Bars Application (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `tests/setup.mjs`)**:
  - `activateAura()` now detects all allied tokens (crawlers, pets, friendly tokens with disposition 1) within the aura radius and automatically calls `grantTempBars()` on them.
  - Excludes hostile and neutral targets.
  - `deactivateAura()` cleanly clears temporary health bars from both the caster and all affected allies who received them from this aura.
  - Spell chat card now explicitly enumerates all allies protected by the aura.
- **Universal Temporary Health Bar Damage Absorption (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/apps/combat-metrics.mjs`, `src/dcc.mjs`, `tests/setup.mjs`)**:
  - Added `_absorbDamageIntoTempBars()` to `DCCActor._preUpdate` and `MockActor.update` to intercept any direct HP modifications (such as token HUD bar edits or direct updates) and absorb damage slot-by-slot before permanent HP is touched.
  - Overrode `modifyTokenAttribute()` on `DCCActor` to route token HUD negative HP edits through `applyDamage()`.
  - Added `dccDamageHandled` option in `DCCCombatMetrics.applyDamageToTarget` to prevent double absorption.
  - Updated chat damage feedback to show absorbed bonus bars.
- **Character Sheet & Combat Tracker Display (`templates/actors/parts/page1-core.hbs`, `src/apps/combat-tracker.mjs`, `templates/apps/combat-tracker.hbs`)**:
  - Character sheet: Added a gold shield badge (`[🛡️ +X Bonus Bars (Y HP)]`) directly next to the `Temp:` input in the numeric HP header row, alongside the existing structured bar grid.
  - Combat tracker: Enriched combatant turns with `hasTempBars`, `tempBarsCount`, `tempBarsTotalHp`, and `tempBarsSource`, rendering an active gold shield badge in each combatant's HP row.
- **Automated Verification (`tests/aura-workflow.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added unit test cases 10 through 15 verifying Rank 1 (5ft), Rank 15 (20ft cumulative), ally canvas radius detection, hostile filtering, damage absorption via `applyDamage` and `_preUpdate`, ally deactivation cleanup, and combat tracker data enrichment.

## 3.2.0

### CarlRPG 3.2.0 — Tag-Driven Effects Engine, Structured Item Grants & 3.2.0 Migration Subsystem

- **Tag-Driven Consumables & Resource Effects (`src/documents/item.mjs`, `src/data/tags.mjs`, `src/dcc.mjs`, `template.json`)**:
  - Replaced hardcoded item name checks (`itemName.includes('mana potion')`) with structured outcomes tagged with exact tags (`action.restore`, `resource.mana`, `action.heal`, `resource.hp-bars`).
  - Added new `resource` namespace (`resource.mana`, `resource.hp-bars`, `resource.temp-bars`) and `action.restore` to tag registry and taxonomy.
  - Added data-driven outcome resolution in `resolveSingleOutcome()` supporting `restore_resource` / `mana` alongside damage and heal types.
  - Updated `useLoot()` and added `useItem(options)` alias with interactive `.dcc-apply-mana-btn` chat message listener for 1-click crawler mana restoration.
- **Tag-Driven Damage Reductions (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/data/tags.mjs`)**:
  - Eliminated brittle description regex parsing (`desc.match(/(\d+)%/)`) in `actor.getDamageReduction(damageType)`.
  - Replaced with exact element tag resolution via `damageTypeToElement()` and debuff/buff matching against `element.*` tags, evaluating structured `reductionPercent` and `reductionFlat` properties directly.
- **Structured Item Grants (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `template.json`)**:
  - Added `system.grants` schema to `gear`, `loot`, `buff`, and `debuff` items.
  - Structured grant kinds supported: `stat` (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA), `dr`, `evade`, `skill` (granting custom or core skills), `spell` (granting spells with rank and cooldown rules), and `tag_bonus` (tag query bonuses, e.g. query `element.fire`, bonus `+2` to matching spells/skills).
  - Actor `prepareDerivedData()` dynamically applies stat/DR/evade bonuses from equipped gear and active buffs, and aggregates `activeTagGrants` for tag query bonuses.
  - Crawler sheet displays granted spells and skills seamlessly, respecting `modifiedRank` and cooldown rules.
- **Comprehensive 3.2.0 Migration & Pack Rebuild (`src/migrations/migration-3.2.0.mjs`, `src/migration.mjs`, `scripts/build-packs.mjs`)**:
  - Automated migration for all existing items and actor items: converts legacy potion outcomes to structured `restore_resource` / `mana` and `heal` outcomes, converts legacy gear stat bonuses / granted skills / granted spells into structured `system.grants`, and assigns canonical tags.
  - Integrated `migrateWorld320()` into world migration pipeline (`src/migration.mjs`).
  - Rebuilt all LevelDB compendium packs (`packs/items`, `packs/skills`, `packs/spells`, `packs/buffs`, `packs/classes`, `packs/races`, `packs/mobs`, `packs/journals`, `packs/macros`) to version `3.2.0`.
- **Automated Verification (`tests/tag-effects-grants.test.mjs`)**:
  - 8 comprehensive test suites covering structured mana/healing outcomes, damage reduction without regex, gear stat grants, tag query spell/skill bonuses, granted spells in spellbook, and 3.2.0 item migrations.

## 3.1.0

### CarlRPG 3.1.0 — Auras, Temporary Health Bars, Areas of Effect & Combat Round Durations

- **Aura & Area-of-Effect Delivery Subsystem (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/models/items/spell-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/buff-model.mjs`, `template.json`)**:
  - Implemented persistent token-centered Auras scaling dynamically with caster attributes and rank milestones (e.g. *Hot Stuff Aura* base 5ft radius, expanding to 10ft at Rank 10 and 15ft at Rank 15).
  - Added structured AoE delivery definitions supporting placed templates (*Fireball*), persistent auras, ray/cone/circle/rect shapes, target filters (`allies`, `enemies`, `all`, `self`), and emission properties (light/darkness).
  - Added 1-click toggling (`activateAura`, `deactivateAura`, `rollSpell` toggle integration) and interactive chat card action buttons (`Dismiss Aura`, `Place Area of Effect`).
- **Temporary Health Bars Absorption & Depletion Pipeline (`src/apps/combat-metrics.mjs`, `src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `templates/actors/parts/page1-core.hbs`, `styles/dcc.css`)**:
  - Implemented first-absorption temporary health bars (`hp.tempBars`: `count`, `maxCount`, `hpPerSlot`, `currentSlotHp`, `source`).
  - Damage is absorbed slot-by-slot before touching permanent health bars. When a temporary health bar slot is exhausted, `count` decrements and `currentSlotHp` refreshes to `hpPerSlot`.
  - Excessive spillover damage after all temporary health bars are depleted penetrates to permanent HP under strict DCC full-bar rules.
  - Rendered interactive gold shield indicators (`.dcc-temp-bars-container`) directly on the crawler character sheet above the core health bar.
- **Combat Round Duration Clock & Expiration (`src/documents/combat.mjs`)**:
  - Integrated 10-second combat round duration management (`DCCCombat.prototype.processRoundDurations`) triggered automatically on `nextRound()`.
  - Active effects with round durations decrement each combat round; upon expiration, auras and buffs deactivate cleanly, clearing temporary health bars and posting Dungeon AI notification cards to chat.
- **Tag Taxonomy Extensions for Auras, Durations & Delivery (`src/data/tags.mjs`, `tests/aura-aoe-tags.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added new namespaces and tags:
    - `delivery.*` (`delivery.placed`, `delivery.aura`, `delivery.self`, `delivery.target`)
    - `duration.*` (`duration.instant`, `duration.rounds`, `duration.minutes`, `duration.hours`, `duration.combat`, `duration.permanent`)
    - `target.*` (`target.allies`, `target.enemies`, `target.all`, `target.self`)
    - `shape.*` (`shape.aura`, `shape.circle`, `shape.cone`, `shape.ray`, `shape.rect`, `shape.line`)
    - `rule.*` (`rule.temp-health-bars`, `rule.emits-light`, `rule.causes-darkness`, `rule.depletes-on-empty`)
  - Extended `computeDerivedTags()` to dynamically tag spells and buffs with matching delivery, shape, duration, and target tags from their structured configurations.

## 3.0.2

### CarlRPG 3.0.2 — In-Game Tag System Guide, Character Sheet To-Hit Formula Display & Journals Pack

- **Accurate To-Hit Formula Character Sheet Display (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `templates/actors/parts/page1-core.hbs`)**:
  - Replaced the placeholder `${displayToHitStat} (${skillRank})` button display on character sheets with the real evaluated attack roll formula (e.g. `1d20 + 14` when trained, `2d20kl + 4` when untrained or at disadvantage).
  - Enhanced tooltips on attack roll buttons to present the complete context breakdown (e.g. `Roll To Hit (DEX Mod +4 + Rank 10)`).
  - Resolved weapon skill lookups for custom-named weapons (e.g. *Boom Stick* with `associatedSkills: ['Shotgun']`) in `prepareAttackDisplay`, eliminating the bug where custom weapon ranks were displayed as `DEX (0)`.
  - Integrated Aiming passive skill bonus (+Aiming rank) onto disadvantage attack formulas (`2d20kl + total`) and `_resolveWeaponSkills()` canonical suggestions.
- **In-Game Tag System & Content Creation Journal Guide (`src/data/journal-tag-system.mjs`, `packs/journals/`, `system.json`)**:
  - Created official 7-page in-game Journal Entry (`CarlRPG — Tag System & Content Creation Guide`) covering:
    1. *Overview & Tag Taxonomy*: 12 official namespaces, `<namespace>.<identifier>` syntax, data-driven design (Rule 0).
    2. *Tag Manager & Item Tag Editor*: `DCCTagManager`, real-time search, 1-click apply checkboxes, custom tag creation.
    3. *Creating Custom Weapons & Gear*: Item configuration walkthrough (*Goblin Boom Stick*), additive damage calculation.
    4. *Secondary Skills & Disadvantage Offsets*: *Aiming* disadvantage offset and damage bonus tiers, `rule.requires-weapon`, items with cooldown grants (2 hours per rank).
    5. *Custom Spells & Favored Spell Costs*: `favored.<archetype>` reference expansion, +1 MP non-favored penalty, classless crawler exemption.
    6. *Custom Classes, Races & Structured Grants*: `system.grants` array schema (`stat`, `skill`, `spell`, `choice`, `archetype`), TagQuery boolean filters.
    7. *Rule Breaking & Engine Principles*: "All rules will be broken; when players break the rules, they should be rewarded."
  - Added `ensureTagSystemJournal()` to world lifecycle hooks (`ready`), auto-creating/updating the guide in `game.journal`.
  - Added `carl.openTagGuide()` macro command and exposed on `CONFIG.DCC.openTagSystemJournal`.
  - Added `📖 Tag Guide` header button in `DCCTagManager` (`templates/apps/tag-manager.hbs`, `src/apps/tag-manager.mjs`).
  - Added `journals` compendium pack in `system.json` and updated `scripts/build-packs.mjs`.

## 3.0.1

### CarlRPG 3.0.1 — Tag-Centric Item Binding, Additive Weapon Damage & Unequipped Attack Filtering

- **Tag Manager Item Sheet Binding (`src/apps/tag-manager.mjs`, `templates/apps/tag-manager.hbs`, `src/sheets/item-sheet.mjs`)**:
  - Bound `DCCTagManager` directly to item sheets when opened from item headers (`new DCCTagManager({ item: this.item })`).
  - Added target item banner and interactive assignment checkboxes (`isAssigned`) allowing 1-click toggling of tags directly on items.
  - Added option when creating custom tags to immediately apply the new tag to the active item (`applyToItem`).
- **Associated Skills & Additive Weapon Damage (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `actor._resolveWeaponSkills()`: distinguishes primary combat weapon skills (e.g. *Shotgun*) from auxiliary passive skills (e.g. *Aiming*) using tags (`rule.requires-weapon`, `action.attack`, `action.passive`) and proficiency modes.
  - Implemented strictly additive damage parts in `actor.getAttackDamageParts()`: weapon item damage parts (e.g. *Boom Stick* 1d6 Fire) are added to skill base damage (e.g. *Shotgun* 3d10 Piercing), auxiliary passive skill damage (e.g. *Aiming* 3d4 Piercing), and official DCC rank damage dice without overriding.
  - Integrated Aiming disadvantage offset and weapon fumble debuffs based on resolved skills.
- **Unequipped Weapons & Attack Synthesis Filtering (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Updated `actor.getSynthesizedAttacks()`: weapon skills requiring an equipped weapon (`rule.requires-weapon` / `weapon.*`) are no longer synthesized as standalone attacks when no corresponding weapon is equipped.
  - Stowed/unequipped weapon items (`equipped: false`) are filtered out of attack rosters. Only equipped weapons and natural/unarmed attacks (*Pugilism*, *Bite*, etc.) appear.
- **Weapon Skill Tag Taxonomy & Compendium Rebuild (`src/data/skills.mjs`, `packs/skills/`, `src/migrations/migration-3.0.0.mjs`)**:
  - Standardized all 18 canonical weapon skills with `'rule.requires-weapon'`.
  - Rebuilt all 8 compendium packs with updated metadata and tags.

## 3.0.0

### CarlRPG 3.0.0 — Unified Tagging System, Structured Grants & Tag Taxonomy Engine

- **Unified Tagging Architecture (`src/data/tags.mjs`, `src/utils/tag-query.mjs`, `src/apps/tag-index.mjs`)**:
  - Replaced all ad-hoc string comparisons, substring heuristics, and regex matching with exact, namespaced tag IDs across 10 official namespaces (`kind.*`, `action.*`, `element.*`, `archetype.*`, `favored.*`, `weapon.*`, `weaponClass.*`, `weaponProp.*`, `skillGroup.*`, `technique.*`, `rule.*`, `id.*`, and `custom.*`).
  - Implemented `TagQuery` engine (`matchesTagQuery(targetTags, query)`) supporting single string matches, array conjunctions (all required), and structured boolean query objects (`{ all: [], any: [], none: [] }`).
  - Added reference expansion (`expandTagReferences`) allowing `favored.*` spell tags to resolve against corresponding caster `archetype.*` tags.
  - Implemented O(1) in-memory `TagIndex` indexing all world and compendium items, providing instantaneous tag querying and live mutation hooks (`createItem`, `updateItem`, `deleteItem`).
- **Canonical Dataset Tagging & Stable Identifiers**:
  - Tagged all 54 canonical spells, 121 skills, 53 classes, and 30 races with stable identifiers, explicit tags, and rebuilt compendium packs.
  - Data models (`template.json`, `src/models/items/*`) enhanced with `identifier`, `tags`, `grants`, `appliesTo`, and `requires`.
  - Item documents feature `.allTags` getter unifying explicit tags, auto-computed derived tags, and stable identity tags (`id.<type>.<slug>`).
- **Structured Grants & Race/Class Applier Engine (`src/data/race-class-applier.mjs`, `src/data/classes.mjs`, `src/data/races.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented structured `system.grants` on all 53 classes and 30 races, defining exact mechanical payloads (`stat`, `skill`, `spell`, `choice`, `skillModifier`, `benefit`, `detriment`).
  - `parseGrants` preserves custom racial and class skill/spell attributes (`stat`, `checkType`, `baseDamage`, `cooldown`, etc.) while cleanly managing archetype skill modifiers (e.g., Boring Ol' Mage -3 to Dex/Str skills floored at 1).
- **Combat Techniques & Skill Associations (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Configured canonical techniques (Iron Punch, Powerful Strike, Skullcracker, Toss, Dirty Fighting, Smush, Choke Out) with structured `appliesTo` TagQueries.
  - `isTechniqueApplicable` evaluates attack tags using `matchesTagQuery` + `expandTagReferences`, strictly enforcing the canonical rule prohibiting techniques on Unarmed Combat via `rule.no-damage-effects`.
- **Spell Casting & Favored Mana Mechanics (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - `DCCActor.rollSpell` evaluates `favored.*` spell tags against the caster's archetype tags (`actor.getArchetypeTags()`), charging non-favored casters a +1 MP penalty.
  - Correctly exempts classless crawlers (levels 1-2) and pets from the +1 MP penalty per official DCC RPG rules.
- **Tag Manager & Taxonomy UI (`src/apps/tag-manager.mjs`, `templates/apps/tag-manager.hbs`, `templates/items/parts/tags.hbs`)**:
  - Interactive Tag Manager application (`DCCTagManager`) accessible via Item Directory sidebar button, featuring namespace filter tabs, search filtering, tag usage counts, and custom tag creation.
  - Item Sheet Tag Editor partial displaying explicit tag badges with 1-click removal, autocomplete add tag input, identifier slug input, and derived runtime tags indicator.
- **Migration Engine 3.0.0 (`src/migrations/migration-3.0.0.mjs`, `src/migration.mjs`)**:
  - Automated migration engine to upgrade existing campaign worlds and actor items to 3.0.0 without regular expressions.

## 2.4.26

### Combat Technique Scoping, Effects Dropdown Harmonization & Skill Idempotence

- **Combat Technique Scoping & Strict Applicability (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `isTechniqueApplicable(tech, attackItem)`: strictly enforces official DCC RPG rules preventing *Unarmed Combat* from receiving damage effects or combat techniques.
  - Restricted techniques like *Toss* to their associated skills (*Wrasslin*), preventing primed techniques from bleeding into unrelated weapons or unarmed attacks.
  - Updated `_applyTechniquesToDamageParts()`, `rollAttack()`, and `getSynthesizedAttacks()` to filter active and primed techniques via `isTechniqueApplicable()`.
- **Effects Dropdown Scoping & Priming Harmonization (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `templates/actors/parts/page1-core.hbs`)**:
  - Added `actor.getSelectableDamageEffects(attackItem)` which filters valid effects down to those the crawler actually knows or possesses via equipped gear.
  - Updated crawler sheet attack roster (`page1-core.hbs`) to populate the damage effect dropdown from `selectableDamageEffects`, ensuring crawlers only see effects they have unlocked.
  - Synchronized dropdown selection with priming: selecting an effect immediately updates `displayDamage` and passes `selectedEffect` to `rollAttack()` without prompting an extraneous modal dialog.
  - Added immediate re-render on `.attack-damage-effect-select` change listener.
- **Damage Formula Formatting Cleanup (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Cleaned formula token construction in `_buildWeaponAttackProfile()` and `_buildSkillAttackProfile()`, eliminating duplicate `+` signs (`+ +`) and duplicate stat modifier additions.
- **Skill Document Idempotence (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Enhanced `DCCActor.createEmbeddedDocuments()` for `Item` types: when adding a skill that the crawler already possesses, the system deduplicates by retaining the higher rank and upgrading the existing skill document rather than creating redundant duplicates.
- **Automated Verification (`tests/combat-technique-attack-associations.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added comprehensive test suite with 10 unit tests covering technique scoping, primed Toss restriction, selectable effects dropdown filtering, dropdown-to-roll harmonization, formula formatting, and skill idempotence.
  - All 966 unit tests across 179 suites passing with 0 failures.

## 2.4.25


### Character Item Advancement UI & Calculation Refactor

- **Item Sheet Advancement & Schema Alignments (`template.json`, `src/models/items/*`, `src/sheets/item-sheet.mjs`)**:
  - Added structured milestone `rankBreaks` (rank5, rank10, rank15, rank20) support to `AttackDataModel` and `GearDataModel`, allowing custom and artifact weapons/gear to define explicit milestone breaks directly on item documents.
  - Added `healingPerRound` to `BuffDataModel` and `damagePerRound` to `DebuffDataModel` schemas.
  - Fixed HTML nesting and unclosed container `<div>` tags in `templates/items/parts/buff.hbs` and `templates/items/parts/debuff.hbs`.
  - Updated `DCCItemSheet._prepareContext()` and `_updateObject()` to hydrate, edit, and persist `rankBreaks` for `attack` and `gear` items alongside `skill` and `spell`.
- **Equipped Gear Skills & Spells Advancement Integration (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `templates/actors/parts/spells.hbs`)**:
  - Implemented spell derivation loop in `DCCActor.prepareDerivedData()` reflecting gear spell bonuses (`gearSkillBonuses` where `isSpell: true`), calculating `itemBonus`, `modifiedRank`, and `statMod`.
  - Added `actor.getSpellRank(name)` method resolving modified spell ranks from owned spells or equipped gear bonuses.
  - Enhanced `actor.getSkillRank(name)` to inspect equipped gear skill bonuses when a skill document is not directly owned.
  - Enhanced `DCCCrawlerSheet._prepareContext()` with `this._grantedSpells` Map to surface unowned spells granted by equipped gear in `context.spells` with clear `[EQUIPPED GEAR]` badges and gear rank bonus indicators.
  - Connected spell roll and damage action listeners (`.roll-spell`, `.roll-spell-dmg`, `.roll-spell-hit`, and hotlist triggers) to execute from granted spells seamlessly.
- **Buff & Debuff Mechanics & Healing/Damage Over Time (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Added `actor.getHealingOverTime()` and `actor.getDamageOverTime()` aggregation methods totaling per-round healing and damage across active buffs, debuffs, and equipped gear.
  - Normalized `actor.getActiveBuffs()` to support both `buff1..buff3` and `slot1..slot3` keys across external buff slots.
  - Verified and integrated buff/debuff stat modifiers, damage multipliers, damage type reductions, advantage/disadvantage roll modifiers with targeted `affects`, and limb count modifications impacting hands limit.
- **Weapons & Primary Attacks Advancement (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Enhanced `_buildWeaponAttackProfile()` and `rollAttack()` to resolve item-level `rankBreaks` directly from weapons/attacks, ensuring custom weapons scale damage dice, rank dice, and milestone bonuses accurately even without external skill documents.
  - Verified multi-typed damage packets (`damageParts`) rolling and scaling.
- **Automated Verification (`tests/item-attributes-advancement.test.mjs`)**:
  - Created comprehensive test suite with 13 automated unit tests verifying schemas, item sheet hydration/persistence, gear granted skills and spells, buffs/debuffs (HoT, DoT, limb limits, advantage/disadvantage), and weapons with multi-damage packets and item-level rankBreaks.
  - All 956 unit tests across 173 test suites passing with 0 failures.

## 2.4.24

### Advancement Milestones (Rank 5, 10, 15, 20) UI & Compendium Synchronization

- **Item Sheet Advancement Milestones UI (`src/sheets/item-sheet.mjs`, `src/data/rank-dice.mjs`)**:
  - Fixed issue where opening spells (such as *Dirt Clod*) or skills (such as *Pugilism*) to edit did not display their Rank 5, 10, and 15 milestone configurations in the Item Sheet UI.
  - Implemented data-driven `hydrateRankBreaks()` and `parseUpgradeTextToRankBreak()` to automatically parse and populate structured `rankBreaks` (including `damageDice`, `rankDamageDice`, `debuff`, `buffsResistances`, and `notes`) for any existing, embedded, or custom items in `DCCItemSheet._prepareContext()`.
  - Updated `_updateObject()` to persist modified `rankBreaks` and keep legacy `upgrades` synchronized without inadvertently erasing existing notes or milestone descriptions.
- **Canonical Datasets & Compendium Packaging (`src/data/spells.mjs`, `src/data/skills.mjs`, `scripts/build-packs.mjs`)**:
  - Upgraded all 54 spells in `DCC_SPELLS` and all 121 skills in `DCC_SKILLS` with explicit, canonical `rankBreaks` objects containing typed damage dice, rank damage dice, debuff inflictions, and milestone notes.
  - Updated `buildSpells()` in `scripts/build-packs.mjs` to spread `...spell.system`, preserving `rankBreaks`, `damageModifiers`, `optionalEffects`, and advanced schema fields in the compiled compendium packs.
  - Successfully rebuilt all compendium packs (`packs/spells`, `packs/skills`).
- **Actor Damage Roll Scaling & Double-Counting Prevention (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Refactored `getSpellDamageData()`, `getSkillDamageData()`, and `_buildWeaponAttackProfile()` to prioritize structured `rankBreaks` as the primary source of truth.
  - Implemented processed tier tracking (`processedSpellTiers`, `processedSkillTiers`) to guarantee each rank milestone tier is applied exactly once, preventing double-counting between structured `rankBreaks` and legacy upgrade strings.
  - Corrected skill rank resolution in `getSkillDamageData()` using `Math.max` across `modifiedRank` and `sys.rank`, ensuring rank scaling is accurately applied even if derived properties are unprimed.
- **Automated Verification (`tests/rank-breaks-advancement.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added 11 automated unit tests verifying canonical spell and skill datasets, Item Sheet UI context, editing and persistence in `_updateObject()`, cumulative damage scaling across Ranks 1, 5, 10, 15, and zero double-counting.
  - All 943 unit tests passing with 0 failures.

## 2.4.22

### Compendium Skill Validation & Canonical Damage Effects Alignment

- **Comprehensive Compendium Classification (`src/data/skills.mjs`, `src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/data/weapon-associations.mjs`)**:
  - Validated and categorized all 121 skills in the DCC compendium (`DCC_SKILLS`) with strict data-driven flags:
    - **26 Primary Attack Skills** marked with `isAttack: true`, `isTechnique: false`, `hasDamage: true`, `baseDamage`, `damageStat`, and `damageType`:
      - Natural strikes: *Bite*, *Back Claw*, *Slice Attack*
      - Bashing: *Club*, *Improvised Weapons*, *Warhammer*
      - Edge: *Axe*, *Dagger*, *Longsword*, *Rapier*
      - Hand to Hand: *Foot Soldier*, *Noggin Nocker*, *Pugilism*, *Unarmed Combat*, *Wrasslin*
      - Ranged: *Bow*, *Crossbow*, *Handgun*, *Javelin*, *Shotgun*, *Shuriken*, *Slingshot*
      - Reach: *Herding Weapons*, *Lance*, *Polearm*, *Quarterstaff*
    - **7 Canonical Damage Effects** marked with `isTechnique: true`, `isAttack: false`, `hasDamage: false`, `techniqueConfig.isDamageEffect: true`:
      - *Choke Out*: Wrasslin
      - *Dirty Fighting*: Pugilism, Wrasslin
      - *Iron Punch*: Pugilism
      - *Powerful Strike*: Foot Soldier, Noggin Nocker, Pugilism
      - *Skullcracker*: Noggin Nocker
      - *Smush*: Foot Soldier
      - *Toss*: Wrasslin
    - **Strict Unarmed Combat Limitation**: Enforced official DCC RPG limitation (*"Limitations: Cannot choose a Damage Effect"*) by purging `Unarmed Combat` from `appliesTo` and `appliesToTags` across all 7 damage effects, setting `unarmed: []` in `CANONICAL_WEAPON_TECHNIQUE_MAP`, and guarding `actor.getValidDamageEffects()` to immediately return `[]` for Unarmed Combat.
    - **5 Weapon Group Masteries** (*Edged Weapons*, *Blunt Weapons*, *Reach Weapons*, *Ranged Weapons*, *Strike Weapons*): marked `isAttack: false`, `isTechnique: false`, `hasDamage: false`.
    - **2 Tactical Combat Actions** (*Call a Play*, *Intervene*): marked `isAttack: false`, `isTechnique: false`, `hasDamage: false`.
    - **81 Utility / Passive / Crafting Skills**: confirmed non-attack, non-technique.
- **Compendium Packaging (`scripts/build-packs.mjs`)**:
  - Updated `buildSkills()` to preserve all skill schema fields (`...skill.system`), preventing loss of `isAttack`, `isTechnique`, `hasDamage`, `baseDamage`, `damageStat`, `optionalEffects`, and `techniqueConfig` upon building packs.
- **Automated Verification (`tests/attack-vs-technique-classification.test.mjs`)**:
  - Expanded test suite to 10 automated unit tests verifying all 26 attack skills, all 7 damage effects, Unarmed Combat restriction, weapon group masteries, and 121-skill compendium integrity.
  - All 930 unit tests across 163 suites passing with 0 failures.

## 2.4.21

### Primary Attacks vs Combat Techniques Classification (Wrasslin, Pugilism & Toss)

- **Primary Attack & Combat Technique Distinction (`src/data/skills.mjs`, `src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/data/weapon-associations.mjs`)**:
  - Explicitly classified *Wrasslin*, *Pugilism*, *Foot Soldier*, *Noggin Knocker*, and *Unarmed Combat* as primary attack actions (`isAttack: true`, `isTechnique: false`, `hasDamage: true`, `baseDamage`, `optionalEffects`).
  - Explicitly classified *Toss*, *Choke Out*, *Dirty Fighting*, *Iron Punch*, *Powerful Strike*, *Skullcracker*, and *Smush* as combat techniques / damage effects (`isTechnique: true`, `isAttack: false`, `hasDamage: false`).
  - Removed greedy substring matching on `notes.includes('damage effect')` in `actor.getCombatTechniques()` (resolving Rule 0 violation where notes text like "only if no Damage Effect is used" caused attacks to be misclassified as techniques).
  - Added strict data-driven exclusions to `actor.getCombatTechniques()` ensuring primary attacks are never rendered in the Combat Techniques & Maneuvers strip.
  - Added *Pugilism* and *Wrasslin* to `CANONICAL_WEAPON_SKILL_MAP` and `CANONICAL_WEAPON_TECHNIQUE_MAP`.
- **Sheet Attacks Table & Damage Effects Integration**:
  - *Wrasslin* now synthesizes into the Attacks table as a primary attack with DEX/STR checks and displays optional technique choices (*Choke Out*, *Dirty Fighting*, *Toss*).
  - *Toss* functions as an optional combat technique when wrasslin, dealing +1d8 Bludgeoning damage bonus when selected.
  - Preserved AI Favor bonuses (+1 for Wrasslin, +2 for Pugilism) when rolling attacks without techniques.
- **Automated Verification (`tests/attack-vs-technique-classification.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added 5 unit tests validating data definitions, technique exclusion, attacks table synthesis, Toss damage effect execution with Wrasslin, and custom user-created skills. All 925 tests across 163 suites pass with 0 failures.

## 2.4.20

### Enforced Number of Hands & Limbs Subsystem

- **Physiology & Limbs Schema (`template.json`, `src/models/actors/base-actor-model.mjs`, `src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Registered `limbs: { arms: 2, legs: 2, hands: 2 }` in `Actor.templates.baseStats.attributes` and `BaseActorDataModel.defineSchema()`.
  - Added derived attributes on `actor.system.attributes.limbs` (and getter `actor.limbs`): `arms`, `legs`, `hands`, `maxArms`, `maxLegs`, `maxHands`, `deltaArms`, `deltaLegs`, `deltaHands`, `usedHands`, `equippedHandItems`, `exceededHands`, and `handsWarning`.
- **Wielding Hand Tracking (`src/models/actors/base-actor-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/gear-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/attack-model.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `calculateItemHandsRequired(item)`: gear and attacks consume hands based on `wieldMode` (`one_handed` = 1, `two_handed` = 2, versatile `two_handed_disadv_1h` = 1 or 2) or explicit `handsRequired`. Non-hand gear (torso armor, helmets, boots) and non-weapon items consume 0 hands.
- **Buff & Debuff Limb Modifiers (`template.json`, `src/models/items/buff-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/debuff-model.mjs`, `src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Registered `limbModifiers: { arms: 0, legs: 0, hands: 0 }` on `Item.buff` and `Item.debuff` schemas with dedicated editing panels in item sheets.
  - Added `CANONICAL_CONDITION_LIMB_MODIFIERS` for automatic fallback calculations on standard conditions (*Severed Hand*, *Amputated Arm*, *Extra Arms*, *Prosthetic Arm*, etc.).
- **Visual Warning Banners & UI Indicators (`templates/actors/parts/page1-core.hbs`, `templates/actors/parts/page4-inventory.hbs`, `styles/dcc.css`)**:
  - Added `.dcc-hands-warning-banner` on Page 1 (Attacks header) and Page 4 (Inventory) that displays dynamically when `usedHands > maxHands`.
  - Added `Hands: used/max` badge to the Attacks header with red alert coloring when exceeded.
  - Added Limbs & Physiology quick-adjustment controls on Page 1 and Page 4 with GM-editable inputs and non-GM readonly views.
- **Security & Permissions (`src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`)**:
  - Enforced server-side validation in `DCCCrawlerSheet._updateObject`: base limb modifications are restricted to Game Masters, stripping limb fields for non-GM submissions.
- **Automated Unit Test Verification (`tests/enforced-hands-and-limbs.test.mjs`)**:
  - 10 comprehensive unit tests validating default crawler anatomy, hand tracking for 1-handed and 2-handed gear, versatile items, quadrupeds (4 legs, 0 hands), centaurs (4 legs, 2 arms, 2 hands), GM 4-hand adjustment, buff/debuff limb modifications, canonical condition fallbacks, and security stripping.
  - All 918 tests across 162 suites pass with 0 failures.

## 2.4.19

### Unified Item Creation, Canonical Weapon Associations, Default 1x Crits & GM Value Security

- **Unified Global Item Creation Interface (`src/dcc.mjs`, `src/apps/item-manager.mjs`, `src/apps/skill-manager.mjs`, `src/apps/spell-manager.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `createAndEditItem(type, initialData)` and `openGlobalItemCreatorDialog()` on `game.dcc`.
  - Intercepted the Item Directory sidebar "Create Item" button to open the global creation modal, immediately creating the document and launching the full `DCCItemSheet` (Item Builder) editor.
  - Ensured the exact same interface is used globally for creating and editing Weapons, Gear, Spells, Skills, Classes, Races, Buffs, Debuffs, and Loot.
- **Data-Driven Weapon & Skill Associations (`src/data/weapon-associations.mjs`, `src/sheets/item-sheet.mjs`, `templates/items/parts/gear.hbs`)**:
  - Replaced comma-separated text inputs with interactive tag pill badges, dropdown selectors, and auto-suggest actions.
  - Implemented `CANONICAL_WEAPON_SKILL_MAP` and `CANONICAL_WEAPON_TECHNIQUE_MAP` to provide data-driven suggestions without regular expressions or arbitrary substring matching (GEMINI.md Rule 0).
  - Dynamically queries skills with `system.appliesTo` metadata, allowing user-created skills and techniques to integrate seamlessly with weapon auto-suggestions.
  - Added single-click "⚡ Auto-Suggest Skills" and "⚡ Auto-Suggest Techniques" buttons to the item sheet.
- **Default 1x Critical Hit Multipliers (`template.json`, `src/models/items/skill-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/spell-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/gear-model.mjs`, `src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Critical Hit Multipliers now default to 1x across all ranks for items, skills, and spells on creation (`critMultiplier: 1`, `critMultiplierR5: 1`, `critMultiplierR15: 1`).
  - Added an editable Critical Multiplier field to the weapon sheet for straightforward GM adjustments.
- **Gold Value Permission Security (`src/sheets/item-sheet.mjs`, `templates/items/parts/gear.hbs`, `templates/items/parts/loot.hbs`)**:
  - Value fields are restricted to Game Masters: non-GM players see disabled/readonly fields (gated by Determine Value Rank 10 for visibility).
  - Enforced server-side validation in `DCCItemSheet._updateObject`: non-GM submissions automatically strip `system.value` to prevent unauthorized client tampering.
- **Automated Unit Test Verification (`tests/item-creation-and-associations.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added 6 comprehensive test suites covering creation across all 9 item types, data-driven weapon mappings, GM value security, and 1x crit defaults.
  - All 900 automated unit tests pass across 161 test suites with 0 failures.

## 2.4.18

### Item Idempotence, Crawler Cross-Scene Persistence & Compendium Synchronization

- **Compendium-to-World Sync Engine (`src/data/compendium-sync.mjs`, `src/documents/item.mjs`, `src/dcc.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `syncCompendiumItemToWorld` and `registerCompendiumSyncHooks` listening to Foundry VTT's `updateItem` hook and direct document updates.
  - Modifying any Spell, Gear, Loot, Class, Race, Buff, Debuff, or Skill in a compendium pack automatically propagates updates to all actors and world items across the campaign.
  - State preservation: `preserveItemActorState` guarantees actor-specific progression (invested spell ranks, skill ranks and training hours, gear equipped status and quantity, and item charges) is safely preserved while mechanical definitions (damage, bonuses, abilities, and descriptions) update in real-time.
  - Automatic Race and Class bonus refreshing: when a race or class definition changes in a compendium, actors with that race or class have their benefits dynamically refreshed via `actor.applyRace` or `actor.applyClass`.
- **Crawler Cross-Scene Persistence (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `src/dcc.mjs`)**:
  - Enforced `actorLink: true` across crawler and pet prototype tokens, `preCreateToken`, `preUpdateToken`, and scene migration on `ready`.
  - Added synthetic token actor forwarding in `DCCActor.prototype.update`, `createEmbeddedDocuments`, `updateEmbeddedDocuments`, and `deleteEmbeddedDocuments` to ensure edits made to a crawler on any scene persist directly to the world actor, keeping all scenes and tokens synchronized into the future.
  - Form updates submitted via `DCCCrawlerSheet._updateObject` synchronize directly to the base world actor when opened from a scene token.
- **Spell & Entity Idempotence (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `src/apps/spell-manager.mjs`)**:
  - Spells are globally unique on an actor. Adding or dropping an existing spell onto a crawler merges rank (`Math.max(existingRank, incomingRank)`) without creating duplicate spellbook entries.
  - Non-consumable items (gear, weapons, armor) maintain unique discrete entries per acquisition so each can be equipped, enchanted, or modified independently.
  - Consumable loot dropped onto character sheets stacks quantity rather than duplicating entries.
- **Auto-Populating Missing Compendiums (`src/dcc.mjs`)**:
  - Added auto-population of `carl-rpg.races` and `carl-rpg.classes` compendiums from canonical datasets if empty upon system ready.
- **Comprehensive Automated Verification (`tests/item-idempotence.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added dedicated test suite covering all 9 idempotence and cross-scene persistence requirements.
  - Full suite passes at 893 tests across 161 test suites with 0 failures.

## 2.4.17

### Skill Classification & Action Discrimination Engine

- **Decoupled Combat Category from Attack Classification (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `src/apps/crawler-token-hud.mjs`)**:
  - Eliminated legacy heuristics that unconditionally marked any skill with `category: "Combat"` as an offensive attack.
  - Tactical combat actions, defensive interrupts, and utility skills (*Call a Play*, *Intervene*, *Taunt*, *Catcher*) are correctly recognized as non-attack actions (`isAttack: false`) and display with the `[SKILL]` badge on character sheets, Hotlist slots, and Token HUDs.
  - Clicking these skills rolls standard skill checks (`actor.rollSkill(item)`) rather than rolling to hit.
- **Strict Data-Driven Damage Discrimination (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Refactored `getSkillDamageData` to require explicit damage configurations (`system.baseDamage` or `system.hasDamage: true`) or canonical unarmed strikes (*Pugilism*, *Unarmed Combat*).
  - Eliminated greedy regular expression scanning across arbitrary freeform `notes` fields, preventing auxiliary dice in rules descriptions (e.g. *Call a Play*'s "Roll 2d6" or *Intervene*'s "Roll 1d6") from generating unwanted damage rolls.
  - Non-damaging skills cleanly return `hasDamage: false` without defaulting to fallback damage values.
- **Skill Classification Schema & Item Sheet UI (`template.json`, `src/models/items/skill-model.mjs`, `templates/items/parts/skill.hbs`)**:
  - Added explicit `isAttack: false` and `hasDamage: false` booleans to `Item.skill` template schema and `SkillDataModel`.
  - Added dedicated interactive controls to the Skill Item Sheet: `Category` dropdown, `Base Damage Formula` input, `Is Attack Action` checkbox, and `Deals Damage` checkbox.
- **Official Dataset Update (`src/data/skills.mjs`)**:
  - Codified `isAttack: false`, `hasDamage: false`, and empty `baseDamage: ""` for *Call a Play*, *Intervene*, *Taunt*, and *Catcher*.
- **Comprehensive Verification (`tests/skill-classification.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added full test suite validating schema definitions, dataset entries, `getSkillDamageData` discrimination, sheet/hotlist presentation, and synthesized attack roster filtering.
  - 884 tests across 160 suites pass with 0 failures.

## 2.4.16

### Wizard-Driven Choices & Custom Abilities in Race and Class Creators

- **Custom Buffs & Debuffs in Point Builder Studios (`src/apps/base-point-builder.mjs`, `src/apps/race-creator.mjs`, `src/apps/class-creator.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented Section 7 in Race and Class Creator Studios allowing players and GMs to define custom permanent buffs and debuffs with custom name, tier (Minor, Moderate, Major), and description.
  - Full Point Ledger accounting: buffs cost points based on tier (Minor: 2, Moderate: 3, Major: 4), debuffs refund/add budget points (Minor: +1, Moderate: +2, Major: +3) respecting detriment caps.
  - Interactive UI with live badge chips, add/remove handlers, and live ledger synchronization.
  - Export and import JSON serialization preserving custom buffs, debuffs, and advanced skill parameters.
- **Advanced Action & Reminder Skill Schemas (`template.json`, `src/models/items/skill-model.mjs`, `src/models/items/lore-model.mjs`)**:
  - Added `canGainRanks`, `cooldown`, and `baseDamage` to `Item.skill` schema and `SkillDataModel`.
  - Added `buffs`, `debuffs`, `chosenBuffs`, `chosenDebuffs` ArrayFields to `RaceDataModel` and `ClassDataModel`.
  - Studio builder supports action skills with stat checks and base damage formulas (e.g. `1d8+F` unranked).
- **Canonical Igneous Race Codification (`src/data/races.mjs`, `src/data/race-class-applier.mjs`)**:
  - Codified all 7 canonical abilities:
    1. *Volcanic Sprint*: Reminder skill with 1/Day cooldown.
    2. *Lava Burst*: Unranked Action skill (`canGainRanks: false`, `checkType: "Stat Check"`, `stat: "con"`, `baseDamage: "1d8+F"`).
    3. *Harsh Heat Adaptation & Aquatic Respiration*: Permanent environmental racial buff.
    4. *Immunity & Vulnerability*: Permanent *Fire Immunity* buff and *Ice Vulnerability* debuff.
    5. *Burrowing Movement*: Permanent buff granting 20ft burrow speed.
    6. *Inventory Heat Siphon*: Permanent debuff deducting 1 health bar on inventory access.

- **Canonical Dataset Sanitization (`src/data/races.mjs`, `src/data/classes.mjs`)**:
  - Purged bogus spell items (`"two"`, `"a"`) across Igneous, Obsidian Butterfly, Boring Ol' Bard, Boring Ol' Druid, and Black Inquisitor General.
  - Fixed Necromancer spell name (`Rise, Dead Minion!` preserved at Rank 4, not split into two items).
  - Fixed Night Elf canonical stat modifiers (`+3` INT and DEX) and Human stat modifiers (`+2` to all stats).
- **Automated Verification (`tests/race-class-wizard-abilities.test.mjs`)**:
  - Created test suite validating custom buff/debuff ledger accounting, Igneous 7-ability application and clean revocation, dataset sanitization, and studio builder `applyToActor`.
  - All 878 tests across 160 suites pass with 0 failures.

## 2.4.15

### Dynamic Damage Effects & Techniques Engine

  - Eliminated hardcoded string and regex checks across `getSkillDamageData`, `getAttackDamageParts`, `_applyTechniqueBonuses`, and `getCombatTechniques`.
  - Implemented `resolveDamageEffect(chosenEffectRaw, baseItem, options)` to look up technique items dynamically on the actor, fall back to canonical defaults, and merge active milestone rank breaks.
  - Implemented `DEFAULT_TECHNIQUE_CONFIGS` defining structured parameters for canonical maneuvers (*Iron Punch*, *Powerful Strike*, *Skullcracker*, *Smush*, *Toss*, *Choke Out*, *Dirty Fighting*).
  - Implemented `evaluateModifier(baseOrMod, modOrContext, rank)` supporting overloaded calling conventions, flat modifiers, multipliers (`* @rank`), and arithmetic formulas.
- **Dynamic Skill & Technique Schema Expansion (`template.json`, `src/models/items/skill-model.mjs`)**:
  - Expanded `techniqueConfig` schema to include `isDamageEffect`, `appliesToTags`, `baseDiceCountMod`, `baseDiceSidesMod`, `flatDamageMod`, `damageBonus`, `damageType`, `debuffName`, and `cooldown`.
  - Added `baseDiceCountMod` to each tier of `rankBreaks` (`rank5`, `rank10`, `rank15`, `rank20`) for progressive milestone scaling.
- **Manual Technique Creation & Sheet UI (`templates/items/parts/skill.hbs`, `src/sheets/item-sheet.mjs`)**:

- **Automated Unit Testing (`tests/dynamic-damage-effects.test.mjs`)**:
  - Created dedicated test suite validating custom user techniques, milestone rank break scaling without hardcoded names, tag-based discovery, unarmed/weapon attack calculation, and CarlRPG rules compliance.
  - All 873 tests across 160 suites pass with 0 failures.

## 2.4.14

### Runtime Regex Stripping and Structured Static Assets

- **Pre-Compiled Structured Canonical Assets (`scripts/compile-canonical-assets.mjs`, `src/data/races.mjs`, `src/data/classes.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented offline compilation pipeline transforming narrative perk strings into pre-calculated static assets directly in `DCC_RACES` (30 races) and `DCC_CLASSES` (53 classes).
  - Explicitly codifies `stats`, `drBonus`, `movement`, `skills`, and `spells` schemas into the static files, completely eliminating runtime text/regex parsing on canonical race/class application.
- **Combat Runtime Regex Elimination (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Replaced runtime regex matching (`/pugilism/i`, `/unarmed combat/i`, `/fire fingers/i`, `/slice attack/i`) with exact string matching and structured tag checks (`sys.tags`).
  - Replaced maneuver and unarmed checks with high-performance `Set` lookups (`KNOWN_MANEUVERS`, `KNOWN_UNARMED`) and tag lookups.
  - Replaced combat effect regex checks (`/iron punch/i`, `/powerful strike/i`, `/skullcracker/i`, `/toss/i`, `/smush/i`, `/choke out/i`, `/dirty fighting/i`) with exact string matching.
- **Rank Damage Die Structuring (`src/data/rank-dice.mjs`)**:

## 2.4.13

### Interactive Perks and Detriments for Races and Classes

- **Perks and Detriments Extraction & Codification (`src/data/race-class-applier.mjs`, `template.json`, `src/models/items/lore-model.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `extractPerksAndDetriments()` to distinguish benefits/perks from drawbacks/detriments across canonical definitions, point builders, and world items.
  - Handles compound trait lines (e.g. "Immunity to Fire damage, and vulnerable to Ice damage"), split day/night mechanics, and keyword-based detriment classification.
  - Added `detriments`, `chosenPerks`, and `chosenDetriments` arrays to both `race` and `class` Item schemas and DataModels.
- **Interactive Perks & Detriments Modal Dialog (`src/data/race-class-applier.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `promptPerksDetrimentsDialog()` rendering an interactive modal with pre-checked checkboxes for perks and detriments plus optional custom write-in inputs.
  - Cancelling the dialog cleanly aborts race/class application without altering actor state.
  - Headless/automated calls gracefully fall back to full perk/detriment selection or respect explicit `options.chosenPerks`/`options.chosenDetriments`.
- **Mechanical Condition Generation & Tracking (`src/data/race-class-applier.mjs`)**:
  - Refined `parseConditions()` to generate permanent Buff items for Advantage, Immunity, and Resistance traits, and Debuff items for Disadvantage, Vulnerability, and Weakness traits.
  - Stores chosen traits in `system.details.raceAbilities` and `system.details.classAbilities` on the Actor and attaches them to the embedded `race` or `class` Item document.
  - All condition items are flagged with `grantedBy: type` and tracked in `appliedRace`/`appliedClass` flags for clean 100% teardown on race/class swap or removal.
- **Point Builder Integration (`src/apps/base-point-builder.mjs`)**:
  - Point builders extract selected benefits and detriments into `perks` and `detriments`.
  - When applying from the builder (`applyToActor()`), prompts the user to confirm/choose perks and detriments and persists them onto the created item and actor.
- **Character Sheet UI & Re-synchronization (`src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `templates/actors/parts/page1-core.hbs`, `templates/actors/parts/story-extras.hbs`)**:
  - Added `[ ⚙️ Perks & Detriments ]` action buttons on Page 1 Core next to the Race and Class labels and under Tab 5 (Story & Extras).
  - Displays styled visual chips for `chosenPerks` (green badges) and `chosenDetriments` (red badges) on the character sheet.

- **Automated Unit Testing (`tests/race-class-perks-detriments.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added 8 unit tests covering perk/detriment extraction, modal dialog prompts (confirm & cancel), selective application, builder application, sheet re-syncing, clean reversal, and sheet listener triggers.
  - 100% test pass rate across all 862 tests in 159 suites.

## 2.4.12

### Wizard-Driven Choices in Race & Class Application

- **Dynamic Choice Detection & Catalog Matching (`src/data/race-class-applier.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `detectChoices()` to automatically parse choice perks across canonical and custom races and classes (e.g., Dwarf Classic's "+3 in two different crafting Skills of your choice", reach weapon skills, edged weapon skills, universal weapon choices, spell choices, and explicit comma-separated option lists).
  - Implemented `getCatalogOptions()` to provide filtered compendium catalog choices (crafting skills, weapon skills, edged weapons, reach weapons, spells) while offering a custom write-in fallback so player creativity and rule breaking are fully supported.
- **Interactive Choice Wizard Dialog (`src/data/race-class-applier.mjs`)**:
  - Created `promptChoicesDialog()` presenting a styled modal dialog when applying a race or class interactively.
  - Users select desired skills/spells for each choice slot. On cancellation or dialog closure, gracefully aborts application without altering actor state or dropping invalid selections.
  - Fully backward compatible with automated and programmatic calls: headless invocations accept pre-populated `options.choices` or fall back cleanly to valid defaults without hanging.
- **Embedded Document Schema & Full Lifecycle Tracking (`template.json`, `src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/apps/base-point-builder.mjs`)**:
  - Added `chosenSkills` and `chosenSpells` to `race` and `class` item schemas.
  - Chosen skills and spells are persisted onto the race/class item documents embedded on the actor (`system.chosenSkills`, `system.chosenSpells`, `system.skills`, `system.spells`).
  - Integrated with actor lifecycle tracking: chosen skills and spells are granted to the crawler and registered in `appliedRace`/`appliedClass` flags, allowing complete and clean removal via `removeRace()` and `removeClass()`.
  - Updated Character Sheet (`src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`) dropdowns and drag-and-drop listeners to trigger the wizard dialog interactively, reverting dropdown state on cancel.
  - Updated Point Builders (`src/apps/base-point-builder.mjs`, `class-creator.mjs`, `race-creator.mjs`) to resolve choices when applying custom classes or races directly from the builder.
- **Automated Unit Testing (`tests/race-class-choices-wizard.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added 10 unit tests verifying choice detection, catalog filtering, choice resolution, Dwarf Classic crafting choices, Igneous fire abilities, Blade Dancer / Swashbuckler weapon choices, dialog confirm and cancel flows, and point builder integration.
  - 100% test pass rate across all 854 tests in 158 suites.

## 2.4.11

### Skill-Driven Attack Synthesis, Combat Techniques & Maneuvers Strip, and Offline Human PDF Pre-Calculations

- **Unified Attack Roster & Skill Attack Synthesis (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`)**:
  - Synthesized attack roster via `actor.getSynthesizedAttacks()`, unifying equipped weapons with primary unarmed and combat skills (*Pugilism*, *Unarmed Combat*, *Wrasslin'*, *Bite*, *Back Claw*, *Slice Attack*, *Improvised Weapons*, etc.).
  - Primary combat skills compute To-Hit modifiers using exact DCC mechanics (Skill Rank + Stat Mod) and display unified composite damage formulas combining base dice and Rank Damage Die (e.g., Rank 5 Pugilism: `3d2 + 1d4 + 4` Bludgeoning).
  - Character Sheet Core tab displays `[SKILL]` and `[WEAPON]` badges on attack rows for immediate visual clarity.
- **Combat Techniques & Maneuvers Strip (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `templates/actors/parts/page1-core.hbs`, `styles/dcc.css`)**:
  - Implemented dedicated interactive **Combat Techniques & Maneuvers** strip below the Attacks table for secondary combat skills (*Powerful Strike*, *Dirty Fighting*, *Iron Punch*, *Choke Out*, *Skullcracker*, *Toss*, etc.).
  - Supports VTT one-click priming/toggling (`.toggle-combat-technique`) to prepare maneuvers for the crawler's next strike.
  - Primed techniques dynamically inject bonus damage dice and status debuffs (e.g. *Woozy*, *Blinded*, *Stunned*) into attack rolls and damage cards, automatically clearing upon strike execution.
- **Offline Human Character Sheet PDF Calculations (`src/apps/pdf-exporter.mjs`)**:
  - Exported characters now populate the Page 1 Attacks table with fully calculated composite dice formulas and To-Hit bonuses.
  - Appends a dedicated `[COMBAT MANEUVERS]` reference section directly into character notes on Page 1, giving physical table players zero ambiguity about dice and maneuver effects.
- **Automated Unit Testing (`tests/attack-skill-synthesis.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added full test suite verifying unarmed skill synthesis, weapon-skill pairing, technique priming toggling, damage card bonus injection, and PDF composite field population.
  - 100% test pass rate across all 844 tests in 157 suites.

## 2.4.10

### Race Item Sheet Redundant Stat Modifier Box Cleanup & Accurate Stat Application

- **Race Item Sheet Presentation (`templates/items/parts/race.hbs`)**:
  - Removed the redundant `RACIAL ABILITY STAT MODIFIERS` block from the race item sheet partial.
  - Racial traits and stat modifiers remain clearly presented in the dedicated `RACIAL PERKS & TRAITS` list (`perksList`), eliminating duplicate or inconsistent stat representations when viewing Race items in the compendium.
- **Racial Stat Modifier Application Accuracy (`src/data/race-class-applier.mjs`)**:
  - Verified and refined stat parsing in `DCCRaceClassApplier.parseStats` to handle comma-and separated ability lists with Oxford commas (e.g., `+4 Intelligence, Dexterity, and Charisma`) cleanly.
  - Ensures accurate direct application of racial ability score bonuses to Crawler core stats across all races.
- **Automated Unit Testing (`tests/race-class-selection.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added unit test asserting `templates/items/parts/race.hbs` omits the separate stat modifier box while retaining `RACIAL PERKS & TRAITS`.
  - Validated that race application continues to correctly apply stat bonuses to Crawler characters.
  - 100% test pass rate across all 838 tests in 156 suites.

## 2.4.9

### All Canonical Class Templates Loadable & Race Point Ledger Design Parity

- **Full Canonical Class Template Loading (`src/apps/class-creator.mjs`, `templates/apps/class-creator.hbs`)**:
  - Resolved issue where only *Dungeon Dad* would load and the other loadable classes appeared blank:
    - Expanded the Class Creator template selector dropdown from 6 entries to all 54 templates (the canonical custom *Dungeon Dad* preset plus all 53 canonical classes from `DCC_CLASSES`, sorted alphabetically).
    - Upgraded `loadPreset(presetId)` in `DCCClassCreatorApp` to look up classes in `DCC_CLASSES` and fully populate the studio: class name, description, prerequisites, notes, archetype selection, Earth Class flag (detecting Silver Earth Box and Earth Hobby Potion grants), ability scores (STR, DEX, CON, INT, CHA), Damage Reduction (DR), granted skills (including choice skills like *Weapon Skill (Choice)*), granted spells, catalog benefits/detriments, and custom perks.
- **Race Creator Studio Point Ledger Design Parity (`templates/apps/race-creator.hbs`, `src/apps/race-creator.mjs`)**:
  - Redesigned the Race Creator studio right column point ledger to match the Class Creator point ledger layout, typography, and card hierarchy:
    - Integrated `.dcc-studio-sidebar` with `.dcc-sticky-receipt`.
    - Live `.dcc-receipt-header-card` with large `XX / YY BP` gauges (`.dcc-gauge-numbers`, `.dcc-spent-num`, `.dcc-budget-num`), soft-limit legality badge (`.dcc-legality-badge`), and 3-column budget breakdown (`.dcc-budget-breakdown` displaying Base, Detriments, and Target BP).
    - Itemized point receipt card (`.dcc-receipt-items-card`) displaying contributions with clean `.dcc-receipt-row` styling.
    - Preserved direct crawler application (`.dcc-target-crawler-card`), Save as Race Item, Apply to Crawler, and Export JSON actions.
- **Race Creator Template Loading Parity (`src/apps/race-creator.mjs`)**:
  - Upgraded `DCCRaceCreatorApp.loadPreset` to also leverage `DCCRaceClassApplier` for parsing stats, DR bonus, granted skills, spells, and perks into catalog benefits/detriments across all 30 canonical races.
- **Enhanced OCR Cleanup & Data Normalization (`src/data/race-class-applier.mjs`)**:
  - Expanded `cleanOCRText()` to clean intra-word OCR spacing artifacts (`Rag e` -> `Rage`, `Arc anist` -> `Arcanist`, `Alchem y` -> `Alchemy`, `Smithin g` -> `Smithing`, `Ta ttoo` -> `Tattoo`, `r oom` -> `room`, `Manag er` -> `Manager`, `Pet s` -> `Pets`, etc.).
  - Enhanced `matchKnownSkill` and `matchKnownSpell` to strip parenthetical annotations and exclamation points for robust matching against canonical datasets.
  - Updated stat regex to handle optional whitespace between signs and values (e.g. `+ 5 Charisma`) and ignore parenthetical notes.
- **Automated Unit Testing (`tests/class-creator.test.mjs`, `tests/race-creator.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added unit test verifying all 54 templates appear in the Class Creator template selector.
  - Added unit test verifying canonical classes (e.g. *Boring Ol' Barbarian*, *Alchemist*, *Harii*, *Dungeon Dad*) load and populate stats, skills, spells, DR, perks, and ledger points spent without leaving fields blank.
  - Added unit tests for `DCCRaceCreatorApp` verifying canonical race preset loading and verifying that `race-creator.hbs` renders the modern point ledger DOM elements.
  - 100% test pass rate across all 837 tests in 156 suites.

## 2.4.8

### Damage Reduction (DR) Steppers & Incremental Point Accounting in Class and Race Builders

- **Interactive DR Incrementer Controls (`templates/apps/class-creator.hbs`, `templates/apps/race-creator.hbs`, `styles/dcc.css`)**:
  - Added dedicated Damage Reduction (DR) stepper boxes with `[-]` and `[+]` interactive controls directly into Section 2 (*Ability Score & Defense Adjustments*) alongside STR, DEX, CON, INT, and CHA.
  - Automatically calculates and displays the Build Point cost: **2 BP per +1 DR** (e.g. +1 DR = 2 BP, +2 DR = 4 BP, +3 DR = 6 BP) in compliance with Chapter 3 (Page 159) of the Core Rulebook.
  - Styled with DCC slate-blue defense theme (`.dcc-dr-box`, `.dcc-dr-step-btn`, `.dcc-stats-grid.has-dr`) and fluid 6-column responsive grid layout.
- **Moderate Benefit Catalog Synchronization (`src/data/point-build-catalog.mjs`, `src/apps/base-point-builder.mjs`)**:
  - Expanded Moderate Benefits catalog with distinct purchases:
    - `mod_dr_buff_1`: `+1 DR Buff` (2 BP)
    - `mod_dr_buff_2`: `+2 DR Buff` (4 BP)
    - `mod_dr_buff_3`: `+3 DR Buff` (6 BP, standard limit)
  - Seamless two-way synchronization: adjusting the Section 2 DR stepper automatically updates the active catalog benefit in the point ledger/receipt, and checking any DR buff checkbox in the catalog accordion synchronizes the stepper and unchecks alternative ranks without duplicate cost.
- **Data Model, Persistence & Actor Application (`src/apps/base-point-builder.mjs`, `src/apps/class-creator.mjs`, `src/apps/race-creator.mjs`)**:
  - `createItemData()` stamps `system.drBonus` directly onto the generated Class or Race item.
  - `compileAbilitiesList()` includes `+X Damage Reduction (DR)` in perks and abilities text.
  - Full support for JSON export/import and preset loading (including canonical *Dungeon Dad* with +2 DR).
  - `applyToActor()` directly updates `system.attributes.dr.buffs` on the targeted Crawler actor when applied from the studio.
- **Automated Unit Testing & Verification (`tests/class-creator.test.mjs`, `tests/race-creator.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added unit test suites verifying DR stepper incrementing, point ledger costs (2 BP per rank), mutual exclusion in catalog selections, item data generation, export/import round-tripping, and actor DR buff application.
  - 100% test pass rate across the full suite (833 tests passing with 0 failures).

## 2.4.7

### Damage Resistance, Movement Modes, Condition Handling & Dedicated Race/Class Sheets

- **Comprehensive Mechanics Audit & Integration (`src/data/races.mjs`, `src/data/classes.mjs`, `src/data/race-class-applier.mjs`)**:
  - Full audit of all 30 playable races and 53 classes (including *Black Inquisitor General* and point-build canonical *Dungeon Dad*) resolving all unaccounted mechanics:
    - **Damage Resistance (DR)**: Explicitly parses DR bonuses (e.g. Amazonian `+2 DR`, Tigran `+1 DR Buff`, Igneous `+3 DR`) and applies them to `system.attributes.dr.buffs`. Reversing a race or class cleanly subtracts the exact bonus.
    - **Movement Speeds & Modes**: Added support for walk deltas (e.g. Tigran `+10ft Move`) on `system.attributes.speed.move`, as well as special movement modes: `climb` (e.g. Arachnid 20 ft), `swim` (e.g. Crocodilian 20 ft), `fly` (e.g. Bune, Obsidian Butterfly, Skyfowl 20 ft), and `burrow` (e.g. Fathom Dwarf 20 ft). All modes revert cleanly to 0 upon removal.
    - **Advantage & Disadvantage as Custom Active Condition Items**: All Advantage conditions on checks are generated and applied as custom embedded `Item` documents of type `'buff'` (e.g. *Advantage: Feline Reflexes*, *Advantage: High Ground Bravado*, *Advantage: Roadie Rigging*); Disadvantage conditions are generated as custom embedded `Item` documents of type `'debuff'` (e.g. *Disadvantage: Clawed Clumsiness*, *Disadvantage: Highborn Arrogance*, *Disadvantage: Cold-Blooded Torpor*). Both types are flagged with `grantedBy: 'race'|'class'` and automatically deleted when swapping or removing races/classes.
- **Dedicated Race & Class Item Sheets (`templates/items/parts/race.hbs`, `templates/items/parts/class.hbs`, `src/sheets/item-sheet.mjs`)**:
  - Created high-contrast, DCC-themed item sheet partial templates preloaded in `src/dcc.mjs`.
  - Feature responsive header badges for Heritage, Size, DR bonuses, and walk/climb/swim/fly/burrow speeds.
  - Interactive grid displaying STR, DEX, CON, INT, and CHA stat modifiers in DCC Red boxes.
  - Granted Skills and Spells card decks showing names, ranks, and mana costs.
  - Distinct Advantage Buff and Disadvantage Debuff preview cards summarizing generated condition items.
  - Perks & Features bulleted list, prerequisites alert banner, and editable abilities/lore textareas.
- **Data Sanitation & OCR Artifact Cleaning**:
  - Cleaned intra-word spaces across `src/data/races.mjs` and `src/data/classes.mjs` (e.g., `"f or"` -> `"for"`, `"Dext erity"` -> `"Dexterity"`, `"Sk ill"` -> `"Skill"`, `"Cat -like"` -> `"Cat-like"`).
  - Restored *Black Inquisitor General* and cleaned chapter header leakages in *Prison Tattoo Artist*, *Shieldmaiden*, *Spellbinder*, *Santero*, *Shepherd*, *Zulu Warrior*, *Necromancer*, *Street Monk*, *Sacred Paladin*, *Swashbuckler*, *Tigran*, and *Primal*.
  - Rebuilt all LevelDB compendium packs with 53 classes and 30 races.
- **Automated Unit Testing & Verification (`tests/race-class-selection.test.mjs`, `tests/races-classes-compendium.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added unit tests 10 through 15 verifying Amazonian stats, skills (+2 Bow, +2 Endurance, +2 Pugilism), and +2 DR; Advantage buff item generation; Disadvantage debuff item generation; movement deltas and special movement modes; item sheet context preparation; and clean condition/DR removal without side-effects.
  - 100% test pass rate across the entire test suite (831 tests across 156 test suites).

## 2.4.6

### Dynamic Race & Class Selection with Non-Item Rank Preservation & Automated Reversal

- **Character Sheet Core Dropdowns (`templates/actors/parts/page1-core.hbs`, `src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`)**:
  - Replaced static text inputs for Race and Class on Page 1 (Core) with structured `<select>` dropdowns categorized by optgroups.
  - Race selector groups all 30 canonical playable races into *Earth Races (Silver Earth Box)*, *Alien Syndicate Races (Galactic Popularity)*, and custom world races.
  - Class selector groups all 52 canonical classes into 10 archetype groups (*Arcanist*, *Barbarian*, *Bard*, *Cleric*, *Druid*, *Fighter*, *Mage*, *Monk*, *Paladin*, *Rogue*), *Multiclass & Special Classes*, and custom world classes.
  - Custom or uncataloged races and classes display seamlessly with `(Custom)` tags without data loss.
  - Omitted `name` attributes on select elements to ensure clean FormApplication / ApplicationV2 state handling without `FormDataExtended` array serialization bugs.
- **Race & Class Application Engine (`src/data/race-class-applier.mjs`, `src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `DCCRaceClassApplier` with full parsing and application for ability score deltas, granted skills, granted spells, creature size changes, and embedded Item documents.
  - Attached `actor.applyRace(raceId)`, `actor.removeRace()`, `actor.applyClass(classId)`, and `actor.removeClass()` directly to `DCCActor`.
  - Upgraded sheet drag-and-drop (`_onDropItem`) to automatically execute `applyRace` and `applyClass` when dropping Race or Class compendium items onto the sheet.
- **Automated Reversal & Non-Item Rank Preservation**:
  - Cleanly reverts previous race and class benefits when switching or removing:
    - Reverts ability score modifiers from both `value` and `unenhanced` scores.
    - Reverts creature size to base size (`Medium`).
    - Removes embedded Race and Class Item documents.
    - **Skill Rank Preservation**: Accurately subtracts granted ranks from skills. If a character possesses non-item ranks higher than the amount being removed (e.g. natural ranks from grinding or advancement), the skill item is retained at its remaining rank (`currentRank - grantedRank`). If no non-item ranks remain, the item document is cleanly deleted.
- **Automated Unit Testing & Verification (`tests/race-class-selection.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added 9 unit tests covering option group context generation, custom name handling, stat deltas, Dodge skill retention in a Human Fighter to Shapeshifter Mage transition, pure skill deletion, size updates/restorations, and drag-and-drop integration.
  - 100% test pass rate across the full test suite (825 tests across 156 test suites).

## 2.4.5

### Focus Retention & Scroll Jump Prevention in Class & Race Builders

- **Full Focus Retention Across Value Edits & State Changes (`src/apps/base-application.mjs`)**:
  - Enhanced `_saveFocusState` to capture all interactive HTML attributes, including `data-*` attributes (`data-stat`, `data-delta`, `data-id`, `data-type`, `data-heritage`, `data-size`, `data-tier`, `data-index`), element tags, names, values, and cursor selection ranges (`selectionStart`, `selectionEnd`, `selectionDirection`).
  - Synthesizes unique, robust CSS selectors (e.g. `button.dcc-stat-step-btn[data-stat="str"][data-delta="1"]`, `input.dcc-benefit-toggle[data-id="minor_darkvision"]`) with element `matchIndex` fallback to guarantee exact 1-to-1 matching across DOM re-renders.
  - Refactored `_restoreFocusState` to focus restored elements using `target.focus({ preventScroll: true })`, eliminating browser viewport shifts and ensuring the active element stays focused without disorientation.
  - Preserves cursor selection ranges and text positions when typing into search boxes, filter inputs, and name fields.
- **Scroll Preservation Across Re-renders (`src/apps/base-application.mjs`, `src/apps/base-point-builder.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented persistent scroll position tracking in `_saveScrollPositions` and `_restoreScrollPositions` covering `.dcc-studio-builder`, `.dcc-receipt-list`, `.dcc-studio-sidebar`, `.dcc-studio-layout`, and `.window-content`.
  - Configured `scrollY` in `defaultOptions` and `DEFAULT_OPTIONS` across `DCCBasePointBuilderApp`, `DCCClassCreatorApp`, and `DCCRaceCreatorApp`.
  - Added continuous scroll position listeners in `base-point-builder.mjs` to capture user scrolling in real time.
- **Studio Interactive Routing Refactor (`src/apps/class-creator.mjs`, `src/apps/race-creator.mjs`)**:
  - Wrapped all interactive studio state mutators (stepper clicks, heritage pills, archetype pills, size pills, catalog toggles, custom perks, search filtering, tier filters, and accordion expanding/collapsing) in `reRenderWithState(ev, fn)` which primes focus and scroll state saving prior to triggering re-renders.
  - Preserved scroll states in programmatic helper methods (`setArchetype`, `toggleEarthClass`, `setHeritage`, `setSize`).
- **Template & Stylesheet Accessibility Upgrades (`templates/apps/class-creator.hbs`, `templates/apps/race-creator.hbs`, `styles/dcc.css`)**:
  - Converted class catalog accordion headers to native `<button type="button" class="dcc-accordion-header">` elements with accessible `:focus-visible` styling (`#c0392b` outline ring).
  - Explicitly assigned `name="searchQuery"` to search inputs across both studio templates.
- **Automated Unit Testing & Verification (`tests/builder-focus-scroll.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added 14 unit tests validating data attribute selector synthesis, `preventScroll: true` invocation, cursor range preservation, scroll position restoration on `.dcc-studio-builder` and `.dcc-receipt-list`, and listener attachments.
  - Full test suite passing with 0 failures (816 tests across 155 test suites).

## 2.4.4

### Class Creator Studio & Race Creator Studio Compendium Macros

- **Canonical System Macros Added (`src/data/macros.mjs`, `packs/macros`)**:
  - Added **Class Creator Studio** macro (`_id: "dccmacro00000005"`, `macroKey: "class-creator"`, icon: `icons/svg/book.svg`) with Player Observer permissions (default: 2) to launch `DCCClassCreatorApp` directly from the hotbar or compendium.
  - Added **Race Creator Studio** macro (`_id: "dccmacro00000006"`, `macroKey: "race-creator"`, icon: `icons/svg/paw.svg`) with Player Observer permissions (default: 2) to launch `DCCRaceCreatorApp` directly from the hotbar or compendium.
  - Commands feature clean execution chaining through `window.carl`, `game.dcc`, and `CONFIG.DCC` fallbacks with user notifications on failure.
- **Compendium Database Compilation (`scripts/build-packs.mjs`, `packs/macros`)**:

  - Multi-line textarea for pasting notes, bullet points, or speech-to-text transcripts with fallback default crawler selector.
  - Live interactive preview table with inline editing across all parsed fields (crawler, action name, event type, roll total, target DC, 7-tier outcome, damage, healing, damage mitigation, killing blow, untrained check flag, notes).
  - Quick "+ Add Blank Row" and single-click row deletion.
  - Sample notes loader (`Load Sample Notes`) for quick demonstration.

  - Extracts roll totals and target DCs (`16 vs 14`, `16/12`, `total 18 vs DC 14`).
  - Auto-detects natural critical successes (`nat 20`, `crit`, `natural twenty`) and critical fumbles (`nat 1`, `fumble`, `botch`).
  - Detects untrained skill checks (`untrained`, `u/t`, `disadv`) and flags them for end-of-session promotion.
  - Extracts metrics: damage dealt, damage taken (`took X dmg`), healing done (`8 healing`, `healed 12`), damage mitigation (`blocked 5 dmg`, `mitigated 8`), and killing blows (`killing blow`, `boss kill`, `slain`).
  - Identifies target recipients (`on Carl`, `to Donut`) and preserves them in notes while stripping filler words.
- **Instant Chat Command Logging (`src/dcc.mjs`)**:
  - `/rapidlog` or `/batchlog`: Launches the Rapid Batch Import modal from the chat prompt.
  - `/log <shorthand>` or `/rlog <shorthand>`: Directly parses a single shorthand line from chat (e.g. `/log Carl Dodge 16 vs 14 blocked 5 dmg`) and logs it into the active session ledger with zero clicks, suppressing normal chat broadcasting and updating crawler combat metrics in real time.

### Item Sheet Details Opening & Legacy Gold Value Recursion Fix

- **Resolved `Maximum call stack size exceeded` in `BaseItemDataModel.goldValue`**:
  - Fixed infinite recursion loop in `BaseItemDataModel.prototype.goldValue` where fallback was referencing `this.parent?.system?.goldValue` (calling itself on any item without `value` defined, including skills like *Dirty Fighting*, spells, attacks, lore traits, buffs, and debuffs).
  - Cleanly resolved `goldValue` to `Number(this.value ?? this._source?.goldValue ?? this._source?.value ?? 0)` with no recursive lookups.
  - Added `migrateData(source)` in `BaseItemDataModel` to transparently map legacy `goldValue` to `value` on document instantiation and database loading.
- **Enhanced `DCCItem.prototype.goldValue` & `prepareBaseData`**:
  - Safe resolution without mutual recursion across plain objects, legacy schemas, and TypeDataModel instances.
  - Automatically migrates `system.goldValue` to `system.value` for gear and loot items.
- **Registered Missing Handlebars Helpers & Compendium Imports**:
  - Registered missing Handlebars helpers `ne` and `and` in `src/dcc.mjs` to prevent sheet render errors in attack and loot templates.

  - Tracks total surviving crawlers remaining in the World Dungeon (default: 13,000,000), reflecting the iconic LitRPG world counter from Dungeon Crawler Carl.
  - **Dynamic Docking & Alignment**: Dynamically aligns 8px to the right of the Floor Collapse Clock, automatically shifting when the Floor Collapse Clock expands, collapses, or when scene navigation re-renders.
  - **Collapsed Pill State**: Minimizes to a sleek pill badge displaying the group icon (`fa-solid fa-users`) and formatted count (e.g. `12,850,000`). Clicking the pill toggles between collapsed and expanded modes.
  - **Expanded Readout & GM Controls**:
    - **Header**: Shows the `[SURVIVING]` badge and `Crawler Count` title.

  - Included `crawlerCount` and `formattedCrawlerCount` in crawler sheet `getData` context.
- **Automated Unit Testing & Verification**:
  - Added test suite `tests/crawler-clock-hud.test.mjs` validating default values, setting/decrementing/incrementing, bounds checking, number/string parsing with commas, singleton options, fallback HTML generation for GM vs player, docked positioning next to the floor clock, event listeners, and crawler sheet integration.
  - 100% test pass rate across 134 test suites (707 passing, 0 failures).

## 2.2.3

### DCC Item & Equipment Library (Unified Gear & Item Selection)

- **DCC Item & Equipment Library (`DCCItemManager`)**:
  - Implemented `DCCItemManager` (`src/apps/item-manager.mjs` and `templates/apps/item-manager.hbs`), providing a centralized, interactive compendium browser for equipment, weapons, armor, accessories, potions, wands, scrolls, and lottery tickets matching the workflow of `DCCSkillManager` and `DCCSpellManager`.
  - **Category Filtering & Counts**: Added interactive category filter pills (`All`, `All Gear`, `Weapons`, `Armor`, `Accessories`, `All Items`, `Potions / Consumables`, `Scrolls`, `Wands`, `Lottery`) displaying real-time item counts.
  - **Equipment Slot Filter**: Added slot dropdown filter (`Head`, `Torso`, `Arms`, `Hands / Weapons`, `Legs`, `Feet`, `Accessories`).
  - **Live Search & Focus Retention**: Search by name, mechanics summary, notes, or tags with persistent focus preservation.
  - **1-Click Add & Inventory Tracking**: Added `[ + Add to Inventory ]` button to embed items on bound actors, tracking ownership with `[ In Inventory (xN) ]` and `[ + Add More ]` buttons.
  - **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Enables dragging items directly from the library window onto character sheets, maps, or hotbars.
- **Dual Selection & Creation Workflow on Character Sheet (Page 2: Equipment & Inventory)**:
  - Replaced creation-only buttons on Page 2 with dual selection and custom creation controls matching Page 3:

- **Determine Value Skill Appraisal Gating**:
  - Gated gold values within `DCCItemManager` according to the bound crawler's Determine Value skill rank:
    - Rank 0–9: Displays masked `???` values and indicates appraisal lock in the footer.
    - Rank 10+: Displays true evaluated gold prices (`<N> GP`).
- **Canonical DCC Items Dataset & Configuration**:
  - Expanded `DCC_ITEMS` (`src/data/items.mjs`) with canonical weapons, armor, accessories, consumables, and wands.
  - Exposed `CONFIG.DCC.items = DCC_ITEMS` and registered `DCCItemManager` in `game.dcc`, `game.dcc.applications`, and `window.carl.openItemManager`.
  - Registered `systems/carl-rpg/templates/apps/item-manager.hbs` in `loadTemplates` in `src/dcc.mjs`.
  - Added responsive dark theme and hover styles in `styles/dcc.css`.

## 2.2.2
 
### Consumable & Item Spell Free Cast (0 Mana Cost Rule)
 
- **0 Mana Cost for Consumable & Item Spell Effects**:
  - Enforced the rule that whenever a consumable, potion, elixir, spell scroll, wand, or activated gear is used and a spell is cast as the effect, the spell **costs 0 mana** to the caster.
  - Updated `DCCActor.prototype.rollSpell` to accept `options.freeCast`, `options.isConsumable`, `options.isItemEffect`, and `options.originItem` (or passing options as the second argument).
  - When `isFreeCast` is active:
    - Bypasses the insufficient mana failure check, allowing casts to succeed even if the caster has 0 current MP.
    - Prevents mana deduction from the caster's mana pool (`system.attributes.mana.value`).
    - Formats the chat card with `0 MP (Free Cast)` and displays the item source badge.
    - Sets `flags['carl-rpg'].freeCast = true`, `manaCost = 0`, and preserves `baseManaCost` for reference.
- **Scrolls, Wands & Outcome Builder Spell Resolution**:
  - Updated `useLoot` to pass `{ freeCast: true, originItem: this, isConsumable: true, isItemEffect: true }` when casting inscribed spells from scrolls, wands, or direct-bound consumables.
  - Enhanced `resolveSingleOutcome` for `outType === 'spell'` to link with compendium spells (`CONFIG.DCC.spells`) or owned items, automatically triggering a free cast in multi-mode combos and rendering a `[ Cast Spell (0 Mana) ]` action button.
  - Added click listener in `src/dcc.mjs` for `.dcc-cast-spell-btn` with `data-free-cast="true"`.
- **Automated Unit Testing & Verification**:
  - Created `tests/consumable-spell-free-cast.test.mjs` validating 0 mana costs for direct rollSpell with freeCast, scrolls, wands, multi-effect combo elixirs, activated gear, mana preservation, and chat button click handlers.
  - 100% test pass rate across 121 suites (678 passing, 0 failures).

## 2.2.1

### Item Gold Value Appraisal & Determine Value Skill Integration

  - Added dedicated Gold Value inputs to both Gear and Loot item sheets (`templates/items/parts/gear.hbs` and `templates/items/parts/loot.hbs`), gated by character appraisal capability.
  - Added gold values to canonical system compendium items (Normal Mana Potion: 10 GP; Scratch-off Ticket: 5 GP).
- **Determine Value Skill Mechanics**:
  - **Rank 0–4 (Default)**: Crawlers cannot discern item gold values. Gold values are masked as `???` on both the character sheet inventory and item sheets. Value sorting is locked (`🔒 Value (Req. Rank 5)`).
  - **Rank 5–9**: Crawlers unlock the ability to sort their inventory and gear by value (`Value: High to Low` and `Value: Low to High`), while exact numbers remain masked (`???`).
  - **Rank 10+**: Crawlers unlock exact item appraisal, displaying true gold amounts (`<N> GP`) on both the character sheet inventory and item sheets alongside value sorting.
- **Actor Document Helpers & Inventory Sorting**:
  - Added `getSkillRank(skillName)`, `getDetermineValueRank()`, `canDetermineValue()`, `canSeeItemValue()`, `canSortInventoryByValue()`, `sortInventoryByValue()`, and `getInventory()` methods to `DCCActor`.
  - Enhanced `DCCCrawlerSheet.getData()` to decorate items with `goldValue`, `canSeeValue`, and `displayValue` flags and sort gear and loot by value descending, ascending, name, or default order.
  - Added interactive inventory sort selector dropdown (`.inventory-sort-select`) in the header of Page 4 (Inventory).
- **Automated Unit Testing & Verification**:
  - Added comprehensive unit test suite in `tests/determine-value.test.mjs` validating schema defaults, rank detection, capability checks, masking behavior, inventory sorting, item sheet gating, and template bindings.
  - 100% test pass rate across 112 suites (666 passing, 0 failures).

## 2.2.0

### Item Outcome Builder 2.0, Multi-Effect Consumables, Wands, Scrolls & Activated Gear

- **Unified Outcome Builder 2.0 Engine**:
  - Implemented multi-effect outcome support across `loot` (consumables, potions, elixirs, lottery tickets, wands, scrolls) and `gear` (weapons, armor, accessories).
  - **Execution Modes**:
    - `All Effects (Guaranteed Combo)`: All defined effects resolve simultaneously upon consumption or activation. Perfect for complex restorative elixirs, troll blood tonics, and charged combat items.
    - `Weighted Random Outcome`: Generates a single random outcome based on percentage weights summing to 100% (with automatic rebalancing, non-numeric validation, and manual overwrite warnings).
    - `Roll Table`: Directly draws from any designated Foundry VTT RollTable.
- **Rich Effect Types**:
  - **Fixed Health Bar Healing (`heal`)**: Restores $X$ Health Bars immediately ($X \times \text{CON Mod}$ HP), capped at maximum HP.
  - **Heal over Time (`heal_over_time`)**: Applies a HoT condition restoring $X$ bars/round for $Y$ combat rounds, dynamically evaluated and ticked by `DCCCombat` round processing.
  - **Mend Injury (`mend_injury`)**: Mends injuries by severity (`minor`, `major`, or `all`), safely removing matching debuff items from the character.
  - **Cure Debuff (`cure_debuff`)**: Cures debuffs matching a specific filter (e.g. `Burned`, `Poisoned`) or clears all active debuffs.
  - **Grant Buff (`buff`)**: Applies canonical or custom buffs directly to crawler external buff slots or embedded item collections.
  - **Inflict Debuff (`debuff`)**: Applies temporary or permanent negative conditions to target tokens.
  - **Raise Skill Rank (`skill_rank`)**: Permanently increases an actor's skill rank by $+N$ and recalculates modified ranks.
  - **Permanent Stat Boost (`stat_permanent`)**: Permanently increases an unenhanced ability score (STR, INT, CON, DEX, CHA) by $+N$, updating derived DCC stat modifiers and max HP.
  - **Cast Spell / Damage (`spell`)**: Evaluates damage formulas (e.g. `2d12 + Int Mod` Fire) with disadvantage rules and condition triggers.
  - **Roll Table Resolution (`roll_table`)**: Draws from specified RollTables.
- **Wands with Charges Pool & Spell Scrolls**:
  - **Wands & Charged Items**: Configurable charges pool (`charges.value` / `charges.max`) that decrements on each use and persists in inventory when depleted.
  - **Spell Scrolls**: Single-use items allowing casting of inscribed spells with **zero mana required** from the caster.
- **Activated Gear with On-Use Abilities**:
  - Gear items can enable `system.hasActivatedAbility: true` with usage limits / cooldowns (e.g. `"Once per scene"`) and an attached outcomes builder.
  - Activated directly from character inventory via a dedicated `[ ⚡ ]` action button, hotlist, or token HUD.
  - Gear is never deleted when uses or charges reach zero.
- **Interactive Chat Cards**:
  - Multi-effect summary cards with 1-click action buttons: `[ Apply Damage ]`, `[ Apply Healing ]`, `[ Apply Regeneration ]`, `[ Mend Injury ]`, `[ Cure Debuff ]`, `[ Grant Skill Rank ]`, `[ Grant Stat Boost ]`, `[ Apply Buff / Debuff ]`, and `[ Draw from Table ]`.
- **Automated Unit Testing & Verification**:
  - Added `tests/item-effects-builder.test.mjs` verifying models, actor helpers, guaranteed combos, wands with charges, free cast scrolls, activated gear, item sheet context, and chat card click bindings.
  - 100% test pass rate across 112 suites (655 passing, 0 failures).

## 2.0.60

### Session Tracking Crawler Selection Default & Ubiquitous Start Grind UI

- **Session Tracking Auto-Selection (`DCCGrindApp`)**:
  - The Grinding & Downtime Hub now automatically defaults its selected crawlers to those currently tracked in the active session (`DCCSessionEngine.getActiveSession().trackedCrawlerIds` or `session.crawlers`), falling back to all crawlers if no session is active.
  - Keeps party composition seamless and synchronized between session tracking, party progression, and downtime grinding.
- **Prominent & Ubiquitous "Start Grind" Access Across the System**:
  - **Character Sheet Page 1 (Core)**: Added high-visibility `.open-grind-app.dcc-start-grind-btn` (`[ 🏋️ Start Grind ]`) directly in the resting & downtime controls strip alongside the Safe Room buttons and floor clock widget.
  - **Character Sheet Page 3 (Skills)**: Converted the small text link in the skills header into a vibrant, high-contrast `.open-grind-app.dcc-start-grind-btn` (`[ 🏋️ Start Grind ]`).
  - **Scene Floor Clock HUD (`#dcc-floor-clock-hud`)**:
    - Embedded `[ 🏋️ Grind ]` button into the compact pill HUD header with event isolation (`stopPropagation`).
    - Added `[ 🏋️ Start Grind ]` button into the expanded timer banner.
    - Elevated HUD `z-index: 100` to guarantee visibility above all canvas layers and controls.

- **Automated Test Suite**:
  - Added Suite 12 to `tests/grinding.test.mjs` verifying session tracking default resolution and multi-surface Start Grind button presence.
  - Updated `tests/macros.test.mjs` validating canonical system macros.
  - 100% test pass rate across 103 suites (641 passing, 0 failures).

## 2.0.59

### Party Grinding Hub, Scene Floor Clock HUD, Individual Crawler Progression & Use-It-Or-Lose-It Pool

- **Floating Scene Floor Clock HUD (`DCCFloorClockHUD`)**:
  - Implemented persistent on-screen HUD widget anchored below Foundry's scene navigation bar (`#navigation`).
  - Displays real-time hours remaining until floor collapse with LitRPG stylized theme (`⏳ 94h`).
  - Supports collapsible pill mode and full banner mode with 1-click GM manual adjustment buttons (`-5h`, `-1h`, `+1h`, `+5h`), manual numeric input, and instant `[Grind]` launcher.
  - Automatically updates across all connected clients via world setting hooks.
- **Party-Wide Grinding Hub (`DCCGrindApp`)**:
  - **Party Roster Selection**: Checkboxes allow the GM/party to select which crawlers participate in a grinding session.
  - **Crawler Sub-Tabs**: Switch between party members within the hub to view each crawler's skills, banked pool, and test advancement checks.
  - **Single Decrement for Floor Clock**: Floor clock decrements once for the entire party session by non-bonus hours accrued (`hours`).
  - **Use-It-Or-Lose-It Pool Rule**: Unspent hours in each crawler's unallocated pool are reset to zero at the start of a new grind (use it or lose it). Hours already invested on specific skills persist across grinds.
  - **Individual Endurance Checks**: Extended grinding excess hours ($> 5$ hours base) trigger separate Endurance checks ($1d20 + \text{Rank} + \text{CON Mod}$ vs $10 + \text{Floor} + \text{Excess}$) for each crawler. `Fatigued` debuffs are applied *only* to crawlers who fail their individual checks.
- **In-Sheet Skill Hour Allocation & Individual Advancement (`DCCCrawlerSheet` & `page3-skills.hbs`)**:
  - Crawlers can now spend banked pool hours directly from their own sheets using inline `[-1]`, `[+1]`, and `[Fill]` buttons next to each skill.
  - When hours invested meet the required rank threshold, an inline graduation cap advancement button (`Advance (d20 >= Target)`) appears directly on the skill row, allowing crawlers to roll their advancement check individually from their sheet.
- **Automated Test Suite**:
  - Added Suite 11 to `tests/grinding.test.mjs` validating party grinding, individual endurance checks, selective fatigue application, use-it-or-lose-it pool reset, and in-sheet allocation.
  - 100% test pass rate across 103 suites (639 passing, 0 failures).

## 2.0.58

### Fix: DataModel Schema Field Registration & Live Banked Pool Hours Incrementing

- **DataModel Schema Registration (`CrawlerDataModel` & `SkillDataModel`)**:
  - Registered `bankedGrindHours: new fields.NumberField({ initial: 0, integer: true, min: 0 })` in `CrawlerDataModel.defineSchema()` and `PetDataModel.defineSchema()`.
  - Registered `investedHours: new fields.NumberField({ integer: true, min: 0, initial: 0 })` in `SkillDataModel.defineSchema()`.
  - In Foundry VTT v12+, updates to document fields not registered in `defineSchema()` were stripped during data validation, causing `system.details.bankedGrindHours` and `system.investedHours` to reset to 0 in persistent storage.
- **Immediate In-Memory Document Synchronization**:
  - `actor.grindSession(...)` and `actor.allocateGrindHours(...)` now synchronize `this.system.details.bankedGrindHours` and `skill.system.investedHours` directly in memory alongside database persistence, preventing race conditions or stale reads before socket confirmation.
- **Interactive Grinding Hub (`DCCGrindApp`)**:
  - `getData()` now ensures `context.bankedHours` reflects the live grind session result (`lastGrindResult.bankedHours`) and instant pool adjustments when hours are allocated with `+1`, `-1`, or `Max`.
- **Character Sheet Display**:
  - Added live Banked Hours badge (`Pool: X hrs`) to the Page 3 (Skills) banner header, keeping players and GMs informed of their available downtime hours directly on the character sheet.
- **Automated Test Suite**:
  - Added Suite 10 to `tests/grinding.test.mjs` verifying schema field presence and live pool incrementing across `actor.grindSession`, `DCCGrindApp`, and `DCCCrawlerSheet`.
  - 100% test pass rate across 102 suites (634 passing, 0 failures).

## 2.0.57

- **Global Floor Timer Setting (`carl-rpg.floorTimer`)**:
  - Implemented world-scoped setting `floorTimer` defaulting to 100 hours remaining until floor collapse.
  - Added programmatic access and helpers across `DCCActor.getFloorTimer()`, `DCCActor.setFloorTimer(hours)`, `DCCActor.decrementFloorTimer(hours)`, `CONFIG.DCC`, and `globalThis.window.carl`.
- **Manual Floor Clock Adjustment in UI**:
  - **Crawler Sheet (Page 1 Core)**: Added `.dcc-floor-clock-widget` and `.dcc-global-floor-clock-input` directly beside the rest recovery controls, allowing players and GMs to view and manually adjust the active floor timer with instant synchronization.
  - **Grind Application (`DCCGrindApp`)**: Added header Floor Clock badge and editable input (`.floor-timer-clock-input`), live session impact preview, and alert banner displaying floor hours remaining.
- **Grinding Floor Clock Cost (Non-Bonus Hours Accrued)**:
  - Updated `actor.grindSession({ hours, ... })` to decrement the global Floor Timer Clock strictly by **non-bonus hours accrued** (`hours`).
  - Bonus hours gained from maps (Neighborhood Map: $+1$ hr; Borough Map: $+2$ hrs) or Complication table events (Wandering Merchant: $+1$ hr) are added into the training pool (`totalEarnedHours`) without consuming additional floor hours.
  - For example, grinding for 6 hours with a Neighborhood Map accrues 7 training hours into the banked pool, but consumes only 6 floor hours on the global clock.
- **Grinding Chat Card Reporting**:
  - Session chat cards clearly display the floor timer impact: `Floor Timer Decremented: -X hrs (Remaining: Y hrs)`.
- **Automated Test Suite**:
  - Added test suite `9. Global Floor Timer Clock & Non-Bonus Hours Decrementing` to `tests/grinding.test.mjs`.
  - 100% test pass rate across 101 suites (631 tests passing, 0 failures).

## 2.0.56

### Grinding Fatigue & Resting Recovery Verification

- **Grinding Endurance Fatigue Mechanics**:
  - Re-affirmed and strictly unified extended grinding fatigue checks with the canonical **Fatigued** debuff (`type: "debuff"`, `severity: "Minor"`, `icons/conditions/fatigued.webp`).
  - Failing an Unopposed Endurance Check ($1d20 + \text{Rank} + \text{CON Mod}$) for grinding beyond the daily safe threshold directly applies the stackable **Fatigued** debuff ($-1$ penalty on all Checks, Move speed halved).
- **Resting Recovery Validation**:
  - Verified that an **8-Hour Safe Room Long Rest** (`rest('long')`) completely restores all 10 Health Bars, refills all Mana, and removes all stacked **Fatigued** debuffs.
  - Verified that a **30-Hour Full Day Rest** (`rest('fullDay')`) restores all Health Bars, refills Mana, removes all stacked **Fatigued** debuffs, and cures all injuries (*Minor*, *Major*, and *Long-Term*).
  - Verified that short rests (2-hour) and non-combat rests (1-hour) restore partial HP and Mana but do not clear lingering fatigue.
- **Compendium Packaging**:
  - Maintained canonical compendium dataset integrity in `carl-rpg.buffs` with 32 canonical buffs and 30 canonical debuffs (62 total documents).
- **Automated Test Suite**:
  - Expanded `tests/grinding.test.mjs` with comprehensive assertions covering Endurance check failures, debuff stacking, short rest retention, 8-hour long rest removal, and 30-hour full day rest recovery.
  - 100% test pass rate across 100 suites with 628 automated unit tests.

## 2.0.55

### Persistent Banked Hours, Multi-Skill Grinding & Complication Bonus Hours

- **Persistent Banked Hours Across Grinds**:
  - Unspent grinding hours are persistently saved in the crawler's banked hours pool (`system.details.bankedGrindHours`), carrying over from session to session.
  - Skills track **Invested Hours** persistently (`system.investedHours`), allowing higher-level skills (e.g. Rank 14 &rarr; 15 requiring 14 hours) to accumulate hours across multiple grinding days without loss.
- **Simultaneous Multi-Skill Grinding**:
  - Crawlers can now divide and allocate their earned and banked hours across **multiple skills simultaneously** within a single session.
  - Dedicated per-skill allocation controls (`-1`, `+1`, `Fill / Max`) let players distribute hours with a single click.
- **Grinding Complication Bonus Hours**:
  - Encountering helpful events on the 1d20 Complications table (e.g. roll 18–19 *Wandering Merchant / Helpful Guide*) grants **+1 Bonus Hour** added directly to the crawler's available pool.
- **Interactive Grinding Hub (`DCCGrindApp`) Streamlining**:
  - Executing a grind no longer abruptly closes the app; it immediately deposits earned and bonus hours into the visible pool, renders an event notification banner, and allows players to allocate hours and trigger advancements immediately.
  - Individual skill progress bars display current investment vs requirement (e.g. `10 / 14 hrs`).
  - Glowing **Advance (d20 &ge; Target)** action buttons appear as soon as a skill banks sufficient hours.
- **Actor Document Methods**:
  - Implemented `actor.allocateGrindHours(skillId, hours)` for safe two-way transfers between the actor pool and skill items.
  - Implemented `actor.attemptSkillAdvancement(skillId)` for rolling advancement checks, upgrading rank, clearing checked status, and generating celebratory chat cards.
- **Verification**:
  - Added dedicated automated unit tests in `tests/grinding.test.mjs` verifying multi-session accumulation, multi-skill allocation, complication bonus hours, and pool transfers.
  - 100% test suite passing with 0 failures across 100 suites (627 tests passed).

## 2.0.54

- **Interactive Grinding Hub (`DCCGrindApp`)**:
  - Added dedicated **Area Map** dropdown in the session setup: `[No Map (+0 hrs), Neighborhood Map (+1 Safe Hr), Borough Map (+2 Safe Hrs)]`.
  - Added smart **Inventory Auto-Detection**: automatically inspects the actor's inventory items on initialization and defaults to the highest available map held by the crawler.
  - Dynamically updates the Safe Limit status badge with breakdown tags (`Base 5h + 1h Guide + 2h Map`).
- **Actor Engine (`actor.grindSession`) & Grinding Data**:
  - Added `getSafeGrindingThreshold()` helper in `src/data/grinding.mjs`.
  - Updated `actor.grindSession(options)` to accept `mapType`, `mapBonus`, `hasNeighborhoodMap`, and `hasBoroughMap` / `hasBurroughMap`.
  - Embeds map modifier badges in the generated LitRPG chat cards and system flags.

## 2.0.53


### Resting Subsystem & Page 1 Health Bar Integration

- **Rest Action Buttons by Health Total (Page 1)**:
  - Moved the Safe Room Rest from Page 3 into a dedicated, high-visibility resting group (`.dcc-rest-buttons-group`) directly beside the Health total on Page 1 Core.
  - Added 4 interactive rest buttons with tooltips, confirmation dialogs, and color-coded Oswald pill styling:
    - **1h Non-Combat Rest** (`.dcc-rest-btn[data-rest-type="1hour"]`): Recovers 1 Health Bar slot (+CON Mod HP, capped at max HP) and +5 Mana.
    - **2h Short Rest** (`.dcc-rest-btn[data-rest-type="short"]`): Recovers 5 Health Bar slots (+5 × CON Mod HP, capped at max HP) and half Mana regeneration rounded down (`floor(Max Mana / 2)`). Clears short rest conditions (such as *Minor Injury*).
    - **8h Safe Room Long Rest** (`.dcc-rest-btn[data-rest-type="long"]`): Fully restores all 10 Health Bars to 100%, refilled Mana reserves to maximum, and clears all stacked *Fatigued* debuffs and long rest conditions.
    - **30h Full Day Rest** (`.dcc-rest-btn[data-rest-type="fullDay"]`): Complete 30-hour canonical Dungeon Day rest. Restores full Health and Mana, clears fatigue, and recovers from all Injuries (*Minor Injury*, *Major Injury*, *Long-Term Minor Injury*, *Long-Term Major Injury*, broken limbs).
- **Actor Document Unified Rest Engine**:
  - Implemented `actor.rest(restType, options)` handling all 4 rest durations with automated Health and Mana capping, condition removals, and rich LitRPG chat cards.

  - 100% test suite passing with 0 failures across 99 suites (612 tests passed).

## 2.0.52

### Grinding, Skill Advancement & Downtime System

- **Comprehensive Grinding Mechanics**:
  - Implemented the official Renegade Game Studios CarlRPG grinding rules:
    - 5-Hour safe daily grinding limit with 0 exhaustion checks.
    - Extended grinding (> 5 hours) requires an Unopposed Endurance Check ($1d20 + \text{Modified Rank} + \text{CON Mod}$ vs $10 + \text{Floor Number} + \text{Hours Past Safe Limit}$).
    - Failing the Endurance check inflicts the canonical stackable **Fatigued Debuff** (`-1 penalty on all Checks and Move halved. Stackable. Until the end of a long rest.`).
    - Full synergy with Endurance skill perks: Rank 5 (ignore Major Failures), Rank 10 (roll with Advantage if not already Fatigued), Rank 15 (convert Critical Failures to Standard Failures).
    - Guide bonuses (e.g. Huey / Bob) increase the daily safe grinding threshold to 6 hours at no penalty.
- **Skill Advancement Cycle**:
  - Use-Marking: Any skill rolled via `actor.rollSkill(skill)` or `actor.rollAttack(attack)` is automatically marked as **Checked** (`system.checked: true`).
  - Investment Requirement: Allocating grinding hours equal to the skill's current rank ($\text{Hours} = \text{Current Rank}$).
  - Advancement Check: Rolling $1d20 \ge \text{Current Rank}$ permanently increases the skill rank by +1 and clears the `checked` flag; failures retain current rank for future practice.
- **Dedicated Interactive Application (`DCCGrindApp`)**:
  - Modal app featuring duration slider/inputs, guide insight toggles, dynamic excess hours/fatigue warnings, focus skill selection with required hours and targets, and complication rollers.
  - Automatically posts immersive LitRPG chat cards recording hours spent, Floor Collapse Clock advancement (+X hrs), Endurance check details, and skill promotions.
- **1d20 Grinding Complications Table**:
  - Integrated 9 discrete complication tiers: Bugaboo Scout Ambush, Janitor Mob Infestation (Pack Rats / Brindle Grubs), Labyrinthine Dead End / Trap, Equipment Wear, Rival Crawlers, Clean Grind, Scavenged Junk, Wandering Merchant/Guide, and AI-Approved Carnage (Loot Box Award).
- **Safe Room 8-Hour Long Rest (`actor.restSafeRoom()`)**:
  - Fully heals all 10 CON-mod health bars to 100%, refilled Mana reserves, and deletes all stacked `Fatigued` debuffs.
- **Character Sheet Integration**:
  - Page 3 (Skills) features a **Used** checkbox column, a quick **Grind** button for checked skills, and header action buttons for **Grind Hub** and **Safe Room Rest**.
- **Verification**:
  - Created automated test suite in `tests/grinding.test.mjs` (19 tests) verifying progression formulas, safe limits, guide bonuses, endurance rolls, fatigue applications, skill advancements, auto-use checking, Safe Room rests, and app data binding.
  - 100% test suite passing with 0 failures across 99 suites (607 tests passed).

## 2.0.51

### Optional Damage Effects Subsystem for Attacks & Hand-to-Hand Skills

- **Interactive Damage Effect Selection Before Rolling**:
  - Attack rolls (`rollAttack` to-hit and direct damage rolls) now offer the user a choice of valid damage effects before rolling whenever the attack or skill supports them.
  - Implemented `promptDamageEffectDialog(attackItem, options)` displaying an interactive dialog with radio choices, descriptions, rank badges (if owned), and AI Favor notes.
  - Users can select **"No Damage Effect"** or any valid damage effect, or click Cancel to abort the roll.
- **Canonical Hand-to-Hand Skills Support**:
  - **Pugilism**: Choose from *Dirty Fighting*, *Iron Punch*, or *Powerful Strike*. Choosing "No Damage Effect" grants **+2 AI Favor** on hit.
  - **Noggin Knocker**: Choose from *Skullcracker* or *Powerful Strike*. Choosing "No Damage Effect" grants **+1 AI Favor** on hit.
  - **Wrasslin**: Choose from *Choke Out*, *Dirty Fighting*, or *Toss*. Choosing "No Damage Effect" grants **+1 AI Favor** on hit.

  - Attack item sheet (`attack.hbs` and `item-sheet.mjs`) provides an input field for optional damage effects and 4 quick preset buttons: `[+ Pugilism]`, `[+ Noggin Knocker]`, `[+ Wrasslin]`, `[+ Foot Soldier]`.
  - Discovers custom effects defined on attack items or linked skills, allowing any weapon or attack to have optional damage effects.
- **Character Sheet Quick-Select Dropdown**:
  - The attacks table on Page 1 now includes a dropdown selector (`.attack-damage-effect-select`) in the Effects column for any attack with optional effects, allowing crawlers to view and pre-select their active effect directly on the character sheet.
- **Chat Card Continuity & Damage Calculation**:
  - Hit roll chat cards embed `data-damage-effect="${chosenEffect}"` into the "Roll Attack Damage" button so clicking it carries the chosen effect into the damage roll without re-prompting.
  - Chat card banners, flavor text, and flags record the active `damageEffect` and `aiFavorBonus`.
  - Accurately computes effect formulas: Iron Punch (+1d2 base damage and Rank die at R5+), Powerful Strike (multiplies base dice by rank), Skullcracker (+1d4 base damage, rank die at R10+), Toss (+1d8 Bludgeoning + Str mod), Smush/Choke Out (2x multiplier).
- **Verification**:
  - Created automated test suite in `tests/attack-damage-effects.test.mjs` validating canonical effect discovery, custom effects, dialog prompting, cancellation, damage calculation, chat button continuity, and sheet display.
  - 100% test suite passing with 0 failures across 92 suites (588 tests passed).

## 2.0.50

### Buffs & Debuffs Compendium Population & Build Fix

- **Compendium Auto-Population & Self-Healing**:
  - Resolved an issue where the `carl-rpg.buffs` compendium displayed as empty in Foundry VTT.
  - Added self-healing auto-population for `carl-rpg.buffs` (and `carl-rpg.mobs`) in the `ready` hook in `src/dcc.mjs`. If the compendium is empty on world start, the system automatically unlocks, imports all 32 canonical buffs and 30 canonical debuffs (`DCC_BUFFS` and `DCC_DEBUFFS`), and restores pack lock status.
- **LevelDB Compaction & Schema Completeness**:
  - Enhanced `scripts/build-packs.mjs` to call `await db.compactRange('', '\uffff');` prior to closing LevelDB instances, ensuring small packs (like buffs and debuffs) flush the write-ahead log directly into SSTable `.ldb` data tables without relying on lazy compaction.
  - Enriched `buildBuffs()` in `scripts/build-packs.mjs` with full schema mappings (`damageMultiplier`, `statModifiers`, `damageModifiers`, `system` defaults).
  - Rebuilt all system compendium packs (`packs/buffs`, `packs/mobs`, `packs/skills`, `packs/spells`, `packs/macros`, `packs/items`).
- **Verification**:
  - Added compendium population and disk structure verification tests in `tests/buffs.test.mjs`.
  - Added `MockActor.createDocuments` and `MockItem.createDocuments` to `tests/setup.mjs`.
  - 100% test suite passing with 0 failures across 91 suites (581 passed).

## 2.0.49

### Attacks Section Scroll Navigation on Stowed Attacks Toggle

- **Preserve Attack Section Visibility**:
  - Fixed an issue where clicking the `Stowed (N)` button (`.toggle-stowed-attacks-view`) to show or hide stowed attacks re-rendered the sheet and lost the attacks section below the fold.
  - Implemented `_scrollToAttacksSection` in `DCCCrawlerSheet` to automatically locate and smoothly scroll the sheet container (`.sheet-body`) back to the attacks section (`.dcc-attacks-section` / `[data-section="attacks"]`).
  - Added `scrollY: ['.sheet-body']` to `defaultOptions` and hooked into `render`, `activateListeners`, and `_restoreScrollPositions` to prevent stale scroll positions from overriding the view when stowed attacks are shown or hidden.
- **Verification**:
  - Added unit test cases 8 and 9 to `tests/attack-equipment-integration.test.mjs` verifying flag handling, stale scroll position cache cleanup, immediate scrolling to target offsets, and scroll restoration safety.
  - 100% test suite passing with 0 failures across 91 suites.

## 2.0.48

### Public Notoriety: Boss Stars & Crawler Skulls System

- **Color-Coded Star Tiers by Boss Level**:
  - Implemented the official CarlRPG Boss Level hierarchy and color-coded star tiers:
    - **Bronze Star**: Neighborhood Boss (`#cd7f32`, warm bronze sheen)
    - **Silver Star**: Borough Boss (`#dcdde1`, polished steel silver)
    - **Gold Star**: City Boss (`#f1c40f`, radiant gold halo)
    - **Platinum Star**: Country Boss (`#00d2d3`, icy platinum cyan shimmer)
    - **Legendary Star**: Floor Boss (`#e67e22`, molten fiery flame pulse)
    - **Celestial Star**: Dungeon Boss (`#9b59b6`, cosmic violet prismatic aura)
  - Created `DCC_BOSS_TIERS` and `getBossTierFromClassification` in `src/documents/actor.mjs` for canonical classification mapping and normalization.
- **Crawler Skulls for PvP Kills**:
  - Crawlers receive visible bone-white skulls with dark crimson glow (`#ecf0f1` / `#c0392b`) next to their name for each fellow crawler they slay in the dungeon.
- **Public Visibility Across Foundry VTT**:
  - **Crawler Sheet Core Header**: Displays interactive badge strip (`{{{trophyBadges.html}}}`) beside Crawler Name on Page 1 Core.
  - **Trophy Room (Tab 6)**: Added full Public Notoriety Manager on Tab 6 with all 6 Star Tiers, Crawler Skulls, live increment/decrement adjustments, chronological kill logs, and 1-click **Record Boss Kill** and **Record Crawler Kill** dialogs.
  - **Combat Tracker**: Enhanced `DCCCombatTracker` and `templates/apps/combat-tracker.hbs` to render badge strips alongside crawler combatant names.
  - **Chat Message Headers**: Enhanced `onRenderChatMessage` in `src/dcc.mjs` to dynamically attach the crawler's star and skull badge strip to `.message-sender` headers on all attack rolls, spells, checks, and chat messages.
  - **Token Nameplates**: Formatted plain text unicode representations (`★` and `💀`) via `actor.getBadgeSummary().text`.
- **Automated Combat Lethal Damage Tracking**:
  - Wired `DCCCombatMetrics.applyDamageToTarget` (`src/apps/combat-metrics.mjs`) to detect lethal blows.
  - If a crawler deals lethal damage to a Boss Mob, `attackerActor.recordBossKill` is automatically triggered with the appropriate tier, updating counts and broadcasting a Dungeon AI announcement card.
  - If a crawler deals lethal damage to another crawler, `attackerActor.recordCrawlerKill` is triggered, updating skull counts and broadcasting a Dungeon AI announcement card.
- **Verification**:
  - Created automated test suite in `tests/boss-stars-and-skulls.test.mjs` testing tier hierarchy, classification mapping, `getBadgeSummary` formatting with multiple stars and skulls, manual and automated kill recording/deletion, combat metrics lethal blows, combat tracker enrichment, crawler sheet context, and chat message sender badge rendering.
  - Full test suite passes with 0 failures (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`).

## 2.0.47

### Fixed Health Bar Color Gradient Across Total Health Bars

- **Fixed Health Bar Color Gradient Anchoring**:
  - Resolved an issue where the health bar gradient compressed and shifted according to remaining health bars rather than total health bars, causing crawlers with only 1 remaining health bar to incorrectly show green at the end of their bar.
  - Sized `.dcc-health-fill-overlay` to `width: 100%` and `background-size: 100% 100%`, permanently anchoring the continuous linear gradient (`#d32f2f` red -> `#e65100` red-orange -> `#f57c00` orange -> `#fbc02d` yellow -> `#43a047` light green -> `#2e7d32` green) across the entire 100% width of the character's total health bar.
  - Implemented dynamic right-inset masking via `clip-path: inset(0 calc(100% - var(--hp-fill, 100%)) 0 0)` (with `@supports not` container-query `background-size: 100cqw 100%` fallback) so health unmasks left-to-right without compressing or shifting the underlying gradient.
  - Crawlers with 10 of 10 health bars (100% HP) fully unmask into the green, while crawlers with 1 of 10 health bars (10% HP) remain firmly and accurately in the red.
  - Added dynamic `grid-template-columns: repeat(var(--hp-segments, 10), 1fr)` and `repeat({{healthSegments.length}}, 1fr)` to `.dcc-health-segments`, ensuring mobs with variable health bar counts (e.g., 2 or 4 bars) properly divide and label their segments.
- **Verification**:
  - Expanded `tests/health.test.mjs` with comprehensive unit tests verifying gradient stylesheet architecture, `clip-path` inset calculations, total-bar mapping across 10/10 (green), 1/10 (red), 5/10 (yellow), and 0 (empty) states, and dynamic Handlebars template variables.
  - All 566 tests pass across 91 suites with 0 failures (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`).

## 2.0.46

### Buff Slot Deduplication & Automatic Fatal Debuff CON Stat Check

- **Strict Buff Slot Deduplication**:
  - A buff can no longer be assigned to multiple external buff slots simultaneously.
  - Implemented `_preventDuplicateExternalBuffs(changes)` on `DCCActor` (`src/documents/actor.mjs`). Whenever an external buff slot is updated to a buff already assigned in another slot, the previous slot is automatically cleared.
  - In `DCCCrawlerSheet._prepareContext` (`src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`), dropdown options for external buff slots now disable buffs that are already assigned to other slots, appending `(Assigned in Slot X)` in the option label.
  - Quick-assign buttons (`1`, `2`, `3`) on Tab 4 smoothly reassign the buff to the targeted slot while clearing any prior slot.
- **Automatic CON Stat Check Before Fatal Debuff Damage**:
  - Implemented automatic survival checks for crawlers facing lethal end-of-round debuff damage.
  - If a debuff's round-end damage would drop a crawler to 0% on their Health Bar, an automatic **CON Stat Check vs. Difficulty 10 + Floor** (`1d20 + CON Mod`) executes immediately before fatal damage is applied. This check does not consume an action.
  - **On Success**: The debuff immediately ends (removed from the crawler), the crawler completely avoids the damage (preserving their health bars), and an automatic chat notification is generated.
  - **On Failure**: The fatal damage is applied normally, dropping the crawler.
  - Added `actor.checkFatalDebuffProtection(debuff, damageVal, options)` to `DCCActor` and integrated it into `DCCCombat.prototype.triggerRoundEndEffects`.
- **Verification**:
  - Extended `tests/buff-slot-assignment.test.mjs` with test cases verifying deduplication across slots, disabled select options, automatic CON Stat Check trigger at 10 + Floor DC, avoided damage and debuff deletion on success, and damage application on failure.
  - All 564 tests pass across 91 suites with 0 failures (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`).

## 2.0.45

### UI Contrast: High-Contrast Search Bar Font & Placeholder Styling

- **High-Contrast Font Color for Search Bars**:
  - Resolved poor font readability on white search bar backgrounds across applications.
  - In `styles/dcc.css`, explicitly configured `.dcc-sm-search` (Skill Library & Manager), `.spell-search-input` (Spell Library & Compendium), `.condition-search-input` (Buff & Condition Library), and `.dcc-picker-search` (Conditions Compendium Browser) with high-contrast text color (`#111111`, `#000000` on focus) against the white background (`#ffffff`).
  - Added explicit contrast styling for input placeholders (`::placeholder { color: #555555; opacity: 1; }`) ensuring placeholder prompt text is clearly legible without blending into the white field background.
  - Increased contrast on search icons (`.dcc-sm-search-icon` to `#333333`) and clear buttons (`.dcc-sm-search-clear`, `.spell-search-clear`, `.condition-search-clear` to `#555555` with red hover `#c0392b`).
- **Verification**:
  - Expanded `tests/search-box-focus.test.mjs` with automated assertions verifying high-contrast colors, placeholder styling, and template attributes across all search managers.
  - All 563 tests pass across 91 suites with 0 failures (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`).

## 2.0.44

### Character Sheet: Green Slot Number Indicators for Assigned Buffs & Active Effects

- **Green Slot Number Assignment Indicator in Character Buffs & Active Effects**:
  - In Tab 4 (Conditions & Effects) under the `CHARACTER BUFFS & ACTIVE EFFECTS` table, quick-assignment buttons for slots `1`, `2`, and `3` now display as vibrant green (`.is-assigned`, `#27ae60`) whenever that buff or active effect is assigned to the respective slot.
  - On Page 1 (Core) in the `EXTERNAL BUFFS (MAX 3)` / `Active Effects` panel, the slot number label (`.dcc-buff-num`) is highlighted in vivid green when that buff slot is active (`.dcc-buff-slot-entry.is-active`).
- **Toggle Slot Assignment**:
  - Clicking an already assigned slot button in the Buffs & Active Effects table unassigns the buff from that slot (toggles off), clearing the slot and removing the green indicator.
- **Context & State Preparation**:
  - `DCCCrawlerSheet._prepareContext` dynamically checks each buff against actor external buff slots (`buff1`, `buff2`, `buff3`) by ID or resolved name, decorating each buff with `isSlot1`, `isSlot2`, `isSlot3`, and `isAssignedToAnySlot` boolean flags.
- **Verification**:
  - Added test suite `tests/buff-slot-assignment.test.mjs` validating context matching, template class application, CSS green styling, and toggle assignment/unassignment.
  - All 561 tests pass across 90 suites with 0 failures (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`).

## 2.0.43

### UI & Search Subsystem: Focus & Cursor Retention Across Re-Renders

- **Application Focus & Cursor Preservation**:
  - Implemented `_saveFocusState()` and `_restoreFocusState()` in `DCCBaseApplication` (`src/apps/base-application.mjs`) and `DCCCrawlerSheet` (`src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`).
  - Automatically captures the focused input/textarea selector, cursor positions (`selectionStart`, `selectionEnd`), and value prior to re-render, and restores focus and exact cursor placement immediately upon DOM replacement and listener activation.
- **Search Boxes No Longer Lose Focus When Typing**:
  - Resolved focus loss in `DCCSkillManager` (`.dcc-sm-search`), `DCCSpellManager` (`.spell-search-input`), and `DCCBuffDebuffManager` (`.condition-search-input`) where typing individual characters triggered a re-render and dropped focus to the window.
  - Users can now type continuously without interruption or having to re-click the search input.
- **Space & Case Preservation During Live Filtering**:
  - Saved raw user input strings in `rawSearchQuery` to prevent trailing spaces from being swallowed or capitalization altered while typing in search boxes, while preserving trimmed, lowercase matching for filter lookups.
- **UI Ergonomics & Quick-Clear Enhancements**:
  - Added dedicated clear-search button (`.dcc-sm-search-clear`) to `skill-manager.hbs` and adjusted input padding in `styles/dcc.css` to accommodate the clear icon.
  - Added `autofocus` attribute to spell and condition search inputs so dialogs are ready for immediate keyboard typing upon opening.
- **Verification**:
  - Created automated test suite `tests/search-box-focus.test.mjs` verifying selector capture, cursor retention, raw space preservation, mid-string typing placement, and clear refocusing.
  - All 554 tests pass with 0 failures across 90 test suites (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`).

## 2.0.42

### Combat Subsystem: Automated End-of-Round Debuff Damage & Buff Healing

- **End-of-Round Automated Effects Trigger**:
  - `DCCCombat.prototype.nextRound()` and the Foundry `combatRound` hook automatically evaluate and trigger all active debuffs causing damage and all active buffs causing healing across combatants at the end of each round.
  - Implemented `DCCCombat.prototype.triggerRoundEndEffects(round)` with deduplication guards to ensure effects execute exactly once per completed combat round.
  - Generates an authentic Dungeon AI combat recap chat card summarizing all applied damage (with health bar losses and remaining HP) and healing across combatants.
- **Debuff Damage Per Round (`damagePerRound`)**:
  - Extended the `debuff` schema (`template.json`) and item sheet (`templates/items/parts/debuff.hbs`) with a dedicated `system.damagePerRound` input field.
  - Supports versatile expressions: flat values (`5`), dice expressions (`1d6`, `2d4`), health bar counts (`1 bar`), and floor-scaling variables (`1d10+F`, `1d8+F`) referencing the current dungeon floor.
  - Updated canonical debuffs (`Burned`: `1d10+F` Fire, `Poisoned`: `1d8+F` Poison, `Blood Trail`: `1d6+F` Bleed, `Drowning`: `1d6+F` Suffocation).
  - Damage resolution leverages `DCCCombatMetrics.applyDamageToTarget` with `ignoreDR: true` for internal DoTs while strictly honoring elemental resistances and immunities, as well as CarlRPG 10-bar health rules (excess damage within a bar does not spill over, only full bars removed).
- **Buff Healing Per Round (`healingPerRound`)**:
  - Extended the `buff` schema (`template.json`) and item sheet (`templates/items/parts/buff.hbs`) with `system.healingPerRound` and added `Healing / Regeneration` (`heal`) to `system.buffType`.
  - Automatically restores health to the bearer at round end, respecting bar increments and strictly capping at `maxHp`.
- **Crawler Sheet Visual Indicators**:
  - Updated `crawler-sheet.mjs` item summary generation so debuff chips display active DoTs (e.g. `1d8+F Poison DoT/rnd`) and buff chips display active regeneration (e.g. `+1d4 HP/rnd`).
- **Verification**:
  - Created automated test suite `tests/combat-round-effects.test.mjs` verifying schema support, formula evaluation, debuff damage triggering, buff healing capping at max HP, multi-combatant resolution, and round deduplication.
  - All 542 unit tests pass with 0 failures across 85 test suites (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`).

## 2.0.41

### Skills & Spells Tab: Intuitive Deletion & Actions Column Polish

- **Skills List Deletion & Actions Column**:
  - Renamed the 9th column in the Skills table (`templates/actors/parts/page3-skills.hbs`) from `Roll` to `Actions`, and expanded its width to 14% with rebalanced column proportions to avoid horizontal overflow.
  - Added explicit, prominent `.item-delete` trash button with `data-item-id="{{skill.id}}"`, `data-tooltip="Delete Skill"`, `title="Delete Skill"`, and high-contrast red styling (`#c0392b`).
  - Added a descriptive `GEAR` badge with tooltip for gear-granted skills explaining they are derived from equipped items and can be removed by unequipping the corresponding item in Inventory.
- **Spells List Deletion & Actions Column**:
  - Rebalanced the column widths in the Spells table (`templates/actors/parts/spells.hbs`) to allocate a dedicated 18% width for the `Actions` column, preventing button wrapping or clipping.
  - Wrapped spell actions inside `.item-actions` and enhanced the `.item-delete` button with direct `data-item-id="{{spell.id}}"`, `data-tooltip="Delete Spell"`, and `title="Delete Spell"`.
- **Sheet Controller & Stylesheet Enhancements**:
  - Updated `crawler-sheet.mjs` `.item-delete` and `.item-edit` click listeners to support direct `data-item-id` attribute resolution alongside jQuery data cache and ancestor traversal, with automatic sheet re-render (`this.render(false)`).
  - Added unified `.item-actions`, `.item-delete`, and `.item-edit` styling rules in `styles/dcc.css` with hover scaling and color transitions.
- **Verification**:
  - Added unit tests in `tests/item-sorting-deletion.test.mjs` validating template Action headers, delete buttons, tooltips, and functional actor item deletion with reference cleanup across skills and spells.
  - All 534 tests pass with 0 failures across 84 test suites.

## 2.0.40

### UI & Styling: Unified Attack Equip / Stow Icon

- **Consistent Equip / Stow Action Icon**:
  - Updated the equip / stow action button icon in the character sheet's Page 1 Attacks table from `fa-crosshairs` to `fa-shield-halved` (`<i class="fa-solid fa-shield-halved" style="color: #c0392b;"></i>`).
  - Standardized the icon across both the active attacks row and the stowed attacks ready button to match the equipped gear toggle icon in Tab 2 (Equipment & Inventory).
- **Verification**:
  - Added unit test assertion in `tests/attack-equipment-integration.test.mjs` verifying the icon matches `fa-shield-halved`.
  - All 531 tests pass with 0 failures across 84 test suites.

## 2.0.39

### Test Suite Audit & Cleanup: Removal of Obsolete & Negative Regression Assertions

- **Removed Obsolete Tests & Negative Assertions**:
  - `tests/character-sheet-modern-tabs.test.mjs`: Removed assertions that verified the absence of the old 340px column width constraint and the absence of buffs/debuffs tables in `page4-inventory.hbs`.
  - `tests/scratch-off-item.test.mjs`: Removed negative template string assertion checking for an obsolete damage placeholder.
  - `tests/typed-damage.test.mjs`: Removed obsolete suite testing attacks without `damageParts` (legacy pre-multi-typed single dice damage format).
  - `tests/item-skill-modifiers.test.mjs`: Removed legacy tests verifying outdated object-formatted `skillModifiers` data structures.
- **Verification**:
  - All 531 remaining unit tests pass with 0 failures across 84 test suites (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`).

## 2.0.38

### Attack & Weapon Equipment Integration: Hybrid Weapon Classification & Stowed Drawer

- **Hybrid Weapon & Attack Recognition**:
  - Equipping physical weapon gear (items in the `hands` / `holding` slots, items marked with `system.isWeapon: true`, or gear defining `damageParts`) automatically adds the weapon to the Page 1 Attacks table with calculated hit bonuses and damage.
  - Unequipping weapon gear removes it from the active Attacks table and places it into the expandable **Stowed Attacks & Weapons** drawer.
  - Dedicated attack items (`type: "attack"`) now support an `equipped` state (`system.equipped: boolean`, default `true`). Unequipping an attack moves it to the Stowed Attacks drawer.
- **Interactive Sheet Toggles & Stowed Drawer**:
  - Each attack row on Page 1 features a 1-click equipped toggle button (`.attack-toggle-equipped`).
  - Added an expandable Stowed drawer toggled via the `Stowed (N)` button in the Attacks table header (`.toggle-stowed-attacks-view`).
  - The drawer lists all stowed attacks and weapons with their damage and range, including a 1-click `[ Ready / Equip ]` button that immediately readies them back into the active Attacks table.
- **Left Action HUD & PDF Export Integration**:
  - The token Left Action HUD (`DCCCrawlerActionHUD`) automatically includes equipped weapon gear alongside equipped attacks, filtering out any stowed items.
  - PDF character sheet export respects equipped state, ensuring only active, equipped attacks occupy the exported attack slots.
- **Automated Verification**:
  - Added comprehensive test suite `tests/attack-equipment-integration.test.mjs` (7 test scenarios) verifying schemas, classification, sheet context preparation, click listeners, roll resolution, and HUD filtering.

## 2.0.37

### Scratch-off Ticket Outcome Enhancements: Conditional Random Table, Auto-Weights & Validation

- **Conditional Random Table Display**:
  - The Scratch-off Outcomes / Random Table builder is now strictly gated to only display when the item's Loot Type is set to `scratch_ticket` (`Scratch-off Ticket / Lottery`).
  - Standard consumable, treasure, quest, and crafting items keep their sheets clean and uncluttered without the scratch-off table.
  - Selecting "Scratch-off Ticket / Lottery" in `.loot-type-select` reactively reveals the table immediately.
- **Auto-Calculated Outcome Weights**:
  - When outcomes are added via `[ Add Outcome ]`, weights are automatically calculated and distributed evenly to sum to exactly **100%** (e.g., 1 outcome = 100%, 2 outcomes = 50%/50%, 3 outcomes = 34%/33%/33%, 4 outcomes = 25% each).
  - Deleting an outcome via `[ Delete ]` automatically re-balances remaining outcomes to sum to 100%.
  - Added a 1-click `[ Auto-balance to 100% ]` action button in the warning banner to instantly rebalance weights whenever needed.
- **Manual Overwrite & Summation Warning**:
  - Users can freely overwrite any calculated weight with custom values.
  - If the sum of all outcome weights does not equal 100%, the sheet renders an orange warning banner (`Total outcome weight is X% (summation must equal 100%)`) with the auto-balance shortcut, and `_updateObject` triggers a warning notification via `ui.notifications.warn`.
- **Strictly Numeric Weights Enforcement**:
  - Outcome weights cannot be set to non-numeric values.
  - The weight input enforces `type="number"` and `.outcome-weight-input` strips non-numeric characters in real time.
  - `prepareData()`, `prepareBaseData()`, `prepareDerivedData()`, and `_updateObject()` sanitize all weights to valid non-negative integers.
- **Automated Verification**:
  - Added unit test cases 15 through 18 in `tests/scratch-off-item.test.mjs`, validating:
    - Random table conditional visibility for `scratch_ticket` and exclusion for standard loot types.
    - Automatic even weight distribution on outcome addition, deletion, and auto-balance.
    - Manual overwrite preservation, UI warning banners, and `ui.notifications.warn` alerts when sum $\neq$ 100%.
    - Strict sanitization of non-numeric weights across document data preparation and sheet submission.

## 2.0.36

### Loot & Consumable Outcome Enhancements: Buff & Debuff Selection Without DMG

- **Buff & Debuff Selection in Outcome Table**:
  - When configuring a `loot` item's random outcome table with a `buff` outcome, the sheet renders an interactive dropdown allowing the user to choose from all existing canonical buffs (and world items). Selecting an existing buff populates the outcome name and description.
  - When configuring a `debuff` outcome, the sheet renders an interactive dropdown allowing the user to choose from all existing canonical debuffs (and world items). Selecting an existing debuff populates the outcome name and description.
- **Strict Omission of DMG Component for Buff and Debuff**:
  - Buff and Debuff outcomes strictly have **NO damage component**.
  - In `templates/items/parts/loot.hbs`, damage formula and damage type inputs are completely hidden and omitted when the outcome type is `buff` or `debuff`.
  - In `DCCItemSheet._prepareContext` and `_updateObject`, `damage` and `damageType` fields are sanitized and cleared to empty strings whenever outcome type is `buff` or `debuff`.
  - In `DCCItem.prototype.useLoot()`, buff and debuff outcomes bypass all damage evaluation, ensure `evaluatedDmg = 0`, exclude the `.dcc-damage-card` class, and omit all damage text or damage apply buttons from generated chat cards.
- **1-Click Apply Buff & Apply Debuff Chat Actions**:
  - Buff outcome cards render a 1-click `[ Apply Buff ]` action button (`.dcc-apply-buff-btn`) that applies the selected buff to the target crawler (assigning to an open external buff slot or adding an embedded buff item).
  - Debuff outcome cards render a 1-click `[ Apply Debuff ]` action button (`.dcc-apply-debuff-btn`) that inflicts the debuff condition as an embedded item directly onto target actor(s).
  - Added click listeners in `onRenderChatMessage` in `src/dcc.mjs` with smart target fallback prioritizing card `targetId` over arbitrary canvas selections.
- **Automated Verification**:
  - Added unit test cases 9 through 14 to `tests/scratch-off-item.test.mjs`, verifying:
    - Buff outcome has 0 damage, no damage card class, and renders apply buff button.
    - Debuff outcome has 0 damage, no damage card class, and renders apply debuff button.
    - `DCCItemSheet._prepareContext` populates available conditions and strips residual damage.
    - `DCCItemSheet._updateObject` sanitizes buff/debuff form data by clearing damage and damageType.
    - `onRenderChatMessage` click handlers successfully apply buffs and debuffs to target actors.
    - Template renders condition selectors and omits damage inputs for buff and debuff types.

## 2.0.35

### Consumable Items, Scratch-off Lottery Tickets & Items Compendium

- **Multi-Outcome Consumable & Scratch-off System (`LootDataModel`)**:
  - Enhanced `loot` item data model and schema in `template.json` and `src/models/items/loot-model.mjs` with `cooldown`, `lootType`, and `outcomes` array.
  - Added support for $N$-uses consumables (`system.quantity`) that automatically decrement on use and remove upon consuming the final charge.
  - Implemented scene-restricted cooldown enforcement (`system.cooldown: "Once per scene"`): prevents multiple uses within the same scene via item flag tracking (`carl-rpg.lastUsedScene`), automatically refreshing when moving to a new dungeon chamber.
  - Implemented weighted random outcome tables (`system.outcomes`): rolls across configured outcomes (e.g. 50% / 50%) on use.
  - Added canvas token target proximity detection (`targetType: "closest_mob"`): locates the closest alive hostile mob/NPC on the scene and calculates distance from the caster.
  - Evaluates DCC spell damage with crawler Int modifiers (`2d12 + Int Mod` Fire) and DCC rules reminders (Disadvantage to hit, Burned Debuff on $\ge 1$ Health Bar loss).
  - Evaluates DCC Health Bar healing (`healBars * hpPerBar`, where 1 Health Bar = CON modifier) for targets.
- **Interactive Chat Cards & Chat Action Listeners**:
  - Generates rich DCC-styled lottery scratch-off reveal cards in chat with outcome badges, quote/flavor descriptions, and mechanics breakdowns.
  - Added `.dcc-apply-healing-btn` chat listener in `src/dcc.mjs` to apply Health Bar healing directly to recipients, capped at maximum HP.
  - Enhanced `.dcc-apply-damage-btn` chat listener with automatic fallback targeting to target IDs identified by scratch-off cards.
- **Item Sheet Scratch-off Builder**:
  - Redesigned `templates/items/parts/loot.hbs` with quantity, cooldown, loot type dropdown, and an interactive outcome builder table with 1-click **Add Outcome** and **Delete Outcome** controls.
  - Handled array serialization cleanly in `DCCItemSheet._updateObject`.
- **Items & Loot Compendium Pack (`carl-rpg.items`)**:
  - Created `src/data/items.mjs` with `DCC_ITEMS` canonical dataset.
  - Registered `carl-rpg.items` compendium pack in `system.json`.
  - Added auto-population hook on startup in `src/dcc.mjs` and compendium compilation in `scripts/build-packs.mjs`.
  - Preloaded canonical items: **Normal Mana Potion** and **Scratch-off Ticket - Fireball or Custard** (6 uses, 1/scene, 50% Rank 5 Fireball vs 50% Custard Heal 5 Bars).
- **Automated Verification**:
  - Created `tests/scratch-off-item.test.mjs` verifying data model schemas, scene cooldown restrictions, quantity decrements, closest mob target detection, Fireball damage and Custard healing formulas, and canonical compendium items.

## 2.0.34

### Equipment & Inventory Tab Full-Width Stacked Layout

- **Stacked Layout for Tab 2 (Equipment & Inventory)**:
  - Moved the **Inventory & Backpack** table directly below the **Equipped Gear Slots** section, replacing the previous side-by-side fixed-width split columns.
  - Both sections now span the full width (100%) of the character sheet window, eliminating tight horizontal constraints and table crowding.
  - Formatted the Equipped Gear Slots with a clean responsive grid (`.dcc-gear-slots-grid`) that cleanly renders gear slots across two columns with the 10 Accessories spanning the full width across the bottom.
  - Backpack item table now utilizes the entire sheet width for item names, bonus summaries, quantities, and item notes.
- **Automated Verification**:
  - Updated `tests/character-sheet-modern-tabs.test.mjs` to verify DOM order (Equipped Gear Slots preceding Inventory & Backpack), removal of legacy fixed-width column constraints, and presence of full-width container and grid CSS classes.

## 2.0.33

### West Marches Named Party Selection & Creation in PPSM

- **Default Tracked-Only Roster Display**:
  - The Party Progression and Session Manager (PPSM) now defaults to `trackedOnly: true`. Untracked crawlers from other parties or inactive groups are hidden automatically, keeping the session roster clean and focused.
  - Added empty state notice in the crawler grid when no tracked crawlers exist for the active party filter with quick buttons to create a party or manage the roster.
- **Party Dropdown Active Roster Selection**:
  - Selecting a named party in the PPSM **Party** dropdown immediately sets that party as active, tracking all member crawlers in `session.trackedCrawlerIds` and unselecting/untracking all others.
  - Selecting *All Parties* tracks all world crawlers, while *Unassigned* tracks crawlers without a party affiliation.
- **`+ New Party` Dialog Integration**:
  - Added a dedicated **`+ New Party`** button on the Party Overview toolbar next to the Party dropdown.
  - Opens the interactive **Create / Define Named Party** modal dialog with party name text input (including existing party datalist autocomplete) and a full checkbox table of all world crawlers with current party affiliations and bulk **Select All** / **Deselect All** controls.
  - On submission: assigns the party name to all checked crawlers (`system.details.party`), sets them as the session's active tracked roster, updates the active party filter, and hides non-members.
- **Session Engine Enhancements**:
  - Added `DCCSessionEngine.assignPartyToCrawlers(partyName, actorIds)` for bulk party affiliation assignment across crawler actors.
  - Added `DCCSessionEngine.selectPartyForSession(sessionId, partyName)` to set active party and track only member crawlers.
  - Added `DCCSessionManagerApp.prototype.selectParty(partyName)` and `DCCSessionManagerApp.prototype.promptCreatePartyDialog()`.
  - Bulk party select in **Manage Roster Dialog** automatically deselects non-party crawlers when choosing a party.
- **Automated Verification**:
  - Added subtest 12 to `tests/session-manager.test.mjs` verifying default tracked-only view model, named party dropdown tracking, multi-crawler untracking, promptCreatePartyDialog execution, actor party affiliation persistence, and session roster synchronization.

## 2.0.32

### Crawler Token Selection Action HUDs (Hotbar & Left Action Panel)

- **Crawler Token Hotbar HUD**:
  - Automatically activates and displays directly above Foundry's macro bar (`#hotbar`) whenever a crawler token is selected on the canvas.
  - Renders all 10 hotbar slots from the crawler's character sheet hotlist (`actor.system.hotlist`).
  - Full item actions matching character sheet capabilities:
    - **Attacks**: One-click **Hit** (attack roll vs target evade) and **Dmg** (damage packet breakdown).
    - **Spells**: One-click **Cast** (mana cost verification & deduction) and **Dmg** (scaled spell damage).

- **Left Action Panel HUD (Attacks & Non-Passive Skills)**:
  - Automatically activates on the left of the screen, dynamically docked directly below the Scene Navigation bar (`#navigation` / `#scene-list`).
  - **Attacks Section**: Lists all attacks configured on the crawler with item icon, name, damage formula, and immediate **Hit** and **Dmg** action buttons.
  - **Active Skills Section**: Automatically gathers all non-passive skills on the crawler with rank and stat modifier, providing **Check / Hit** and **Dmg** buttons for combat skills and **Roll** buttons for active skills.
  - **Passive Skill Filter**: Automatically filters out passive skills (skills marked with `category: "Passive"`, `checkType` containing "passive" or "no roll", or `skillType: "Passive"`).
  - **Dynamic Positioning & Resizing**: Listens to Scene Navigation rendering and window resize events to ensure the panel always docks cleanly directly below the scene list.
  - **Collapsible**: Toggle button to collapse to header bar for maximum canvas visibility.
- **Master Lifecycle Controller (`DCCCrawlerTokenHUD`)**:
  - Centralized hook integration responding to `controlToken`, `updateActor`, `createItem`, `updateItem`, `deleteItem`, `deleteToken`, and `canvasReady`.
  - Automatically activates when selecting a crawler token and closes when selecting a non-crawler token (mobs, vehicles, NPCs) or clearing selection.
  - Real-time reactivity: updates immediately when actor stats, inventory, equipment, or hotlist change without requiring re-selection.
- **Developer Access**:
  - Exposed on `window.carl.tokenHUD`, `window.carl.openHotbarHUD(actor, token)`, and `window.carl.openActionHUD(actor, token)`.
- **Automated Verification**:
  - Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/crawler-token-hud.test.mjs` verifying template preloading, passive skill discrimination, hotbar slot resolution, action triggers, attack/skill separation, token selection lifecycle, reactive updates, and position calculation.

## 2.0.30

### Global Floor Setting, Mob Evade DC (Base + F), Automatic Target Hit Resolution & Non-Crawler Evade Button

- **Global World Floor Setting (`carl-rpg.currentFloor`)**:
  - Registered world setting `carl-rpg.currentFloor` (Number, default 1, min 1).
  - Exported `getCurrentFloor()` and `setCurrentFloor(floor)` helpers across `game.dcc`, `window.carl`, `CONFIG.DCC`, and `DCCActor`.
  - Added dedicated Floor selector dropdown (`#dcc-global-floor-select`, Floors 1 through 18) directly in the **Party Progression & Session Hub** (`DCCSessionManagerApp`) header controls.
  - Setting changes dynamically re-render open sheets and synchronize target DCs world-wide.
- **Mob Evade Difficulty Formula ($\text{Base} + F$)**:
  - Mob data models and document classes parse and calculate Evade difficulty as a base number plus current floor ($Base + F$).
  - Derives `effectiveEvadeDC = base + currentFloor` (e.g. base 14 becomes DC 15 on Floor 1, DC 18 on Floor 4).
  - Mob Page 1 Core character sheet dynamically displays the live effective DC `(DC X)` alongside the base statblock string.
  - Added `getEvadeTargetDC()` method on `DCCActor` for polymorphic DC resolution.
- **Automatic Attack Target Hit Resolution**:
  - `actor.rollAttack(item, ...)` and `actor.rollSpellAttack(item, ...)` automatically evaluate against all active targets (from roll options or `game.user.targets`).
  - Evaluates hit or miss: compares the attack total to target DC (mob Base $+ F$ or crawler Evade).
  - Automatically embeds a high-contrast **Target Evaluation** matrix in the attack chat card showing target names, target DCs, and visual `[HIT (+X)]` or `[MISS (-X)]` pills.
  - Stores full target resolution results in chat message flags (`flags['carl-rpg'].targetResults`).
- **Non-Crawler Attack Evade Button & Crawler Evade Rolls**:
  - Whenever an attack is rolled by a non-crawler (mob, boss, hostile NPC), the attack chat card embeds an interactive **Roll Evade** button (`.dcc-evade-roll-btn`).
  - Any player crawler clicking the button triggers `crawler.rollEvade({ attackTotal, attackerName, floor })`.
  - The crawler executes an official Evade roll ($d20 + \text{DEX Mod} + \text{Gear} + \text{Buffs}$) against the attack total.
  - Generates an official chat card declaring `SUCCESSFULLY EVADED!` or `EVADE FAILED — HIT TAKEN!` with full roll formula and modifiers.
- **Automated Verification**:
  - Added test suite `tests/evade-and-floor.test.mjs` verifying global floor settings, mob evade base+F scaling, target hit evaluation, active target resolution from `game.user.targets`, non-crawler evade button insertion, and crawler rollEvade evaluation.
  - All 83 test suites passing with 0 failures (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`).

## 2.0.27

### Mob Embedded Attacks, Spells & LevelDB Sublevel Hydration Fix

- **Embedded Items Sublevel Hydration in LevelDB (`packs/mobs`)**:
  - Diagnosed and resolved issue where mobs opened from the `carl-rpg.mobs` compendium pack were missing attacks, spells, and loot in Foundry VTT v12.
  - Resolved root cause: In Foundry VTT v12's `expandEmbedded` architecture for Actor compendiums, the primary actor record in `!actors!${actorId}` must store `items` as an array of item IDs (`[itemId1, itemId2, ...]`), while the item documents themselves must be stored in the sublevel `actors.items` under key `${actorId}.${itemId}` (raw key `!actors.items!${actorId}.${itemId}`).
  - Updated `scripts/build-packs.mjs` (`buildMobs`) to correctly separate actor records and store all 381 embedded items across the 84 mobs into the `actors.items` sublevel.
- **Spellcaster Mobs Defined & Enriched with Spells & Mana Pools**:
  - Defined and assigned authentic `type: "spell"` items and mana attributes to all 16 spellcaster mobs from the *Game Master's Campaign Toolkit*:

    - *Wise-Guyy Crawler*: Eldritch Blast (2d10 Force, 10 MP), Arcane Shield (5 MP), Punch. Mana pool: 50/50.
    - *Prosperity Prophet*: Coin Barrage (3d10 Bludgeoning, 25 MP), Golden Smite (2d12 Radiant, 20 MP), Golden Scepter. Mana pool: 80/80.
    - *Mind Horror*: Psychic Scream (3d8 Psychic, 20 MP), Mind Flay (2d10 Psychic, 15 MP), Tentacle Flail. Mana pool: 75/75.
    - *Rakish Werehound Shocker*: Shocking Howl (2d8 Lightning, 15 MP), Thunder Clap (2d6 Thunder, 10 MP), Shock Claws. Mana pool: 40/40.
    - *Laminak Manager*: Performance Review (2d8 Psychic, 15 MP), Demotion Curse (1d10 Necrotic, 10 MP), Clipboard Smack. Mana pool: 35/35.

    - *Troglodyte Virtuoso*: Discordant Screech (2d8 Thunder, 15 MP), Dirge of Despair (1d10 Psychic, 10 MP), Bone Flute Bash. Mana pool: 40/40.
    - *Goblin Bomb Bard*: Cacophony (2d8 Sonic, 15 MP), Pyrotechnic Blast (2d10 Fire, 20 MP), Bomb Toss. Mana pool: 45/45.
    - *Krakaren Clone*: Entropic Pulse (3d8 Force, 20 MP), Psionic Wave (2d10 Psychic, 15 MP), Tentacle Slam. Mana pool: 70/70.
    - *Beloved Mimic*: Deceptive Allure (2d8 Psychic, 15 MP), Pseudopod Slam, Devour. Mana pool: 50/50.
    - *Dream Eaters*: Nightmare Harvest (2d10 Psychic, 20 MP), Phantasmal Touch. Mana pool: 60/60.
    - *The Hoarder*: Arcane Surge (2d10 Force, 20 MP), Junk Barrage. Mana pool: 55/55.
  - Ensured all 84 mobs have at least one physical `type: "attack"` item (170 total attacks, 29 total spells, 182 loot items across the 84 mobs).
- **Actor Sheet UI Quick-Cast & Spells Display on Page 1**:
  - Updated `templates/actors/parts/page1-core.hbs` to render a dedicated **SPELLS & MAGIC** section on Page 1 (Core & Combat) whenever a mob actor has embedded spells (`{{#if spells.length}}`).

    - Removed `tests/sidebar-hooks.test.mjs` (tested Foundry core HTMLElement vs jQuery wrapper handling).
  - Cleaned obsolete negative-template checks across test suites:
    - Updated `tests/spells.test.mjs`, `tests/hotlist.test.mjs`, and `tests/debuffs-management.test.mjs` to eliminate stale checks referencing legacy removed template comments or partial inclusions.
- **Node.js Native Coverage Tooling**:
  - Established native V8 coverage reporting using Node.js built-in test runner:
    `node --test --experimental-test-coverage --test-coverage-include="src/**" tests/*.test.mjs`
  - Created automated audit script `scripts/coverage.mjs` (`npm run test:coverage`) that evaluates per-file line coverage against a strict $\ge 75\%$ threshold and outputs a status table.
- **Coverage Expansion to $\ge 75\%$ Across All Repository Modules**:
  - Added targeted test suites to bring every single module in `src/` to $\ge 75\%$ line coverage (overall codebase coverage now **91.34%** with 0 failing tests across 471 assertions):
    - `tests/mob-and-item-models-extended.test.mjs`: Raised `mob-model.mjs` from 18.10% to 100.00% and `documents/item.mjs` from 60.36% to 84.73%.
    - `tests/item-sheet-actions.test.mjs`: Raised `sheets/item-sheet.mjs` from 51.88% to 81.51%.
    - `tests/combat-archive-and-tracker-extended.test.mjs`: Raised `apps/combat-archive.mjs` from 38.13% to 78.09% and `apps/combat-tracker.mjs` from 48.16% to 75.18%.
    - `tests/managers-extended.test.mjs`: Raised `apps/buff-manager.mjs` from 67.01% to 97.57%, `apps/skill-manager.mjs` from 45.66% to 80.85%, `apps/spell-manager.mjs` from 52.99% to 85.75%, and `apps/crawler-creator.mjs` from 69.70% to 83.11%.
    - `tests/dcc-entry-extended.test.mjs`: Raised system entry point `src/dcc.mjs` from 55.44% to 76.97%.
- **Engine Reliability & Environment Hardening**:
  - Added safety checks for headless and Node.js testing environments in `src/apps/combat-tracker.mjs` (safely guards `typeof document !== 'undefined'`) and `tests/setup.mjs` (`MockDocumentSheet.isEditable = true`, chained jQuery mock, and async `Hooks.callAll` promise resolution).

## 2.0.23

### Character Sheet Modernization (Option A: 5-Tab Modern Layout)

- **Option A Clean 5-Tab Character Sheet Architecture**:
  - Restructured the Crawler character sheet into an intuitive 5-tab workflow:
    1. **Tab 1: Core & Combat** (`1: Core & Combat`): Vitals, Enhanced/Unenhanced Ability Scores, Health Bar, Mana, Evade & DR, Attacks, Active External Buff Slots (1–3), Active Debuffs chip summary, and 10-slot Hotlist.
    2. **Tab 2: Equipment & Inventory** (`2: Equipment & Inventory`): Consolidates equipped body slots (`Head`, `Torso`, `Arms`, `Hands/Holding`, `Legs`, `Feet`, `Accessories (Max 10)`) alongside physical backpack items (`Gear` and `Loot`). Includes equipped state badges, notes inputs, quantity editing, equip toggles, and item deletion. Buffs and debuffs have been completely removed from this tab.
    3. **Tab 3: Skills & Spells** (`3: Skills & Spells`): Unified abilities and magic center presenting combat/utility skills and the character spellbook in a single view with direct compendium pickers, roll buttons, damage calculations, and drag-and-drop reordering.
    4. **Tab 4: Conditions & Effects** (`4: Conditions & Effects`): Dedicated condition management hub tracking all character buffs, active effects, and debuffs with severity badges (`Minor`, `Moderate`, `Major`), duration tracking, and quick-assignment buttons (`1`, `2`, `3`) to directly assign buffs to External Buff slots 1–3.
    5. **Tab 5: Story & Sponsors** (`5: Story & Sponsors`): Consolidated narrative and crawler background (Popularity, Past Traumas with 1d12 roll button, Loose Ends with 1d12 roll button, Regrets with 1d12 roll button, Notes), Companions & Personal Space (Pet Companion, Mount/Vehicle, Personal Space, Deity/Patron), and Features & Sponsors (Racial Traits, Class Talents, Corporate Sponsors 1–3).
- **Controller & Event Handling**:
  - Added `.buff-assign-slot-btn` click handler in `DCCCrawlerSheet` (`src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`) allowing players to assign any character-owned buff to External Buff slots `buff1`, `buff2`, or `buff3` with a single click and user notification.
- **Template Preloading & Styling**:
  - Registered `conditions.hbs` and `story-extras.hbs` in `loadTemplates` in `src/dcc.mjs`.
  - Added CSS rules in `styles/dcc.css` for `.dcc-slot-assign-btn-group`, `.buff-assign-slot-btn`, and tab container styling.
- **Full PDF Parity Maintained**:
  - 100% data schema compatibility preserved across all 6 pages of the official fillable PDF exporter (`src/apps/pdf-exporter.mjs`), ensuring AcroForm mappings for gear slots, story details, items, skills, and spells function without interruption.
- **Automated Test Coverage**:
  - Added `tests/character-sheet-modern-tabs.test.mjs` verifying tab structure, partial preloading, inventory gear slots consolidation, buff/debuff removal from inventory, conditions tab quick-assignment, and story details.
  - Verified 100% pass rate across all 457 unit tests in the repository.

## 2.0.22

### Custom Buff Option Selection & External Buff Prioritization

- **Single-Match External Buff Option Selection**:
  - Refactored `context.externalBuffSlots` option selection in `DCCCrawlerSheet` (`src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`). Replaced uncoordinated multi-group mapping with strict single-match resolution that guarantees only ONE `<option selected>` exists across all dropdown optgroups.
  - Prioritizes character-owned buffs (`📦 Character Buffs`) over compendium defaults. When an actor creates a custom buff with the same name or type as a compendium buff (e.g. custom "Strength Buff" or "Strength +5" granting +5 STR), the character's owned buff is marked selected, preventing the compendium default `⚡ Strength Buff (+2 STR)` from overriding it in the DOM.
  - Implemented prioritized hierarchical resolution: (1) exact ID match with `resolvedBuff.id`, (2) exact ID match with `valStr`, (3) exact name match checking owned buffs before compendium options.
- **Custom Buff String Parsing & Regex Optimization**:
  - Optimized ability score regex parsing in `DCCActor.resolveBuff` (`src/documents/actor.mjs`). Placed full stat names (`strength`, `intelligence`, `constitution`, `dexterity`, `charisma`) ahead of 3-letter abbreviations (`str`, `int`, `con`, `dex`, `cha`) in alternation, and added support for postfixed values (e.g. `Strength +5`, `STR +5`, `Strength 5`).
- **Condition Library Character Buff Discovery**:
  - Extended `DCCBuffDebuffManager.getUnifiedConditions` (`src/apps/buff-manager.mjs`) to include buffs and debuffs directly owned by the bound character, making custom actor-specific conditions visible and manageable in the condition browser.
- **Automated Test Suite**:
  - Added test coverage in `tests/buffs.test.mjs` validating custom buff selection with +5 STR, name collision resolution between owned and compendium buffs, and postfixed custom buff string parsing. Verified 100% passing test suite across all 451 unit tests.

## 2.0.21

### Inventory, Spells, & Skills Drag Reordering & Item Removal

- **Drag-and-Drop List Reordering**:
  - Implemented `_onSortItem(event, itemData)` on `DCCCrawlerSheet` to handle dynamic reordering of items within the sheet.
  - Dropping an owned item onto another row in the same collection (spells, skills, gear, loot) calculates new relative sort values and updates `item.sort`.
  - Updated context preparation in `getData()` to prioritize `item.sort` with alphabetical name fallback across `context.gear`, `context.loot`, `context.spells`, `context.skills`, `context.buffs`, `context.debuffs`, and `context.attacks`.
- **Item Removal & Slot Cleanup**:
  - Enhanced the `.item-delete` click listener with event bubbling isolation (`preventDefault` and `stopPropagation`).
  - Automatically unbinds deleted items from `system.hotlist` and `system.attributes.externalBuffs`, preventing dead ID references.
  - Confirmed and unified `.item-delete` delete buttons with trash icons and tooltips across all lists in `page4-inventory.hbs`, `spells.hbs`, and `page3-skills.hbs`.
- **Sheet Navigation & Tab Cleanup**:
  - Renamed the second tab from `2: Hotlist & Gear` to `2: Gear & Story` in `crawler-sheet.hbs` and `lang/en.json`, reflecting that the Hotlist is located on Page 1 (Core).
- **Automated Test Coverage**:
  - Added dedicated test suite in `tests/item-sorting-deletion.test.mjs` validating `item.sort` ordering, `_onSortItem` drop calculations, drag-and-drop routing, and hotlist/buff cleanup on deletion.
  - Verified 100% passing test suite across all 448 unit tests.

## 2.0.20

### Hotlist Drag-and-Drop & Dropdown Population Restoration

- **Hotlist Drag-and-Drop & Owned Item Resolution**:
  - Configured native drag-and-drop selector `[data-item-id]` on `DCCCrawlerSheet` so all items, spells, attacks, and skills can be dragged directly onto any of the 10 Hotlist slot boxes.
  - Implemented smart compendium and world item matching: dragging a compendium spell, item, or buff onto a character sheet or hotlist slot checks if an item with the same name and type is already owned by the actor. If found, it reuses the existing owned item rather than creating redundant duplicates.
  - Added `draggable="true"` attributes to item table rows across `page1-core.hbs`, `spells.hbs`, `page4-inventory.hbs`, `page3-skills.hbs`, and populated hotlist boxes in `hotlist.hbs`.
- **Spell Manager Item Drag Serialization**:
  - Enhanced `_onDragStart` in `DCCSpellManager` to locate full spell system definitions from `CONFIG.DCC.spells` and `game.items`. Spells dragged from the catalog carry complete type, image, and system payloads for seamless dropping.
- **Dropdown Selection Event Isolation**:
  - Added `ev.stopPropagation()` to `.hotlist-select` and `.external-buff-select` change handlers. This prevents the change event from bubbling up to Foundry's form harvester, eliminating race conditions where generic form submission clobbered the hotlist slot update.
  - Excluded `.hotlist-select` and `.external-buff-select` from the generic form blur submission listener.
- **Combat & Utility Skills on Hotlist**:
  - Added a dedicated **Skills** optgroup to the Hotlist slot dropdowns so players can directly assign combat masteries (Edge, Bashing, Reach, etc.) and utility skills to hotlist slots.
  - Expanded `getData()` slot parsing to support `slotType === 'skill'`: determines attack classification, assigns `ATTACK` or `SKILL` badges, renders Rank and damage formulas, and wires `.roll-hotlist-attack`, `.roll-hotlist-attack-dmg`, and `.roll-hotlist-use` to trigger `actor.rollAttack` or `actor.rollSkill`.
- **Automated Test Coverage**:
  - Expanded `tests/hotlist.test.mjs` with subtests covering unowned compendium item drops, existing item duplicate prevention, skills optgroup selection, event bubbling isolation, and skill roll execution.
  - Verified 100% passing test suite across all 443 unit tests.

## 2.0.19

### Mob Embedded Loot Items & Combat Sheet Integration

- **Embedded Loot Items on All Mobs**:
  - Converted all mob treasure notes across all 23 entities in `DCC_MOBS` (`src/data/mobs.mjs`) into 64 embedded items of `type: "loot"`.
  - Each loot item features unique IDs, descriptive names, custom SVG icons (`icons/svg/`), quantities (e.g. 10 Crossbow Bolts, 7 Copper Nibs), and atmospheric flavor notes.
  - Players and GMs can now inspect, use, or drag-and-drop loot items directly between mob tokens and crawler character sheets.
- **Mob Attacks & Spells Integration**:
  - Validated and structured all 52 attacks and tactical spells as `type: "attack"` items with exact toHitStat, damageDice, damageStat, damageType, and debuff effects.
  - Offensives and tactical spells (*Fireball*, *Mini Fireball*, *Firestrike*, *Firebolt*, *Heal Others*, *Clap Cloud*, *Magic Missile*, *Scream*, *Gloat*) roll directly from the Attacks table on the Mob sheet without requiring spell slots or mana prep.
  - Added dedicated **Devour** action (`1d4 Healing`) to **Critical Consensus** for its *Constant Hunger* ability.
- **Page 1 (Core) Mob Treasure & Loot Drops Section**:
  - Added a dedicated **TREASURE & LOOT DROPS** table directly to Page 1 (Core) of the Mob sheet.
  - Features real-time item rows with icon, name, inline quantity editing (`item-inline-edit`), notes, use/chat-drop, sheet edit, and delete buttons, plus an "Add Loot" button.
  - Retained header summary field for backwards compatibility while giving GMs direct in-combat access to mob drops.
- **Template & Data Schema Updates**:
  - Added `description` field to `loot` item schema in `template.json`.
  - Rebuilt binary LevelDB compendium pack `packs/mobs` with all embedded loot and attack items.
- **Automated Test Coverage**:
  - Added section 7 to `tests/mobs-compendium.test.mjs` verifying embedded loot existence, attack validity, Devour action, crawler sheet context population, and LevelDB compendium integrity.
  - Verified 100% passing test suite across 438 tests.

## 2.0.18

### Game Master's Toolkit Mob Compendium & Entity Dataset

- **Official Mob Compendium (`carl-rpg.mobs`, `packs/mobs`)**:
  - Created and registered the official `mobs` compendium pack in `system.json` as an `Actor` compendium with `PLAYER: OBSERVER` ownership.
  - Built and populated the LevelDB compendium with all 22 monsters and bosses from the official *Game Master's Toolkit - Entities List* (plus the canonical Pack Rat).
- **Entities List Dataset (`src/data/mobs.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `DCC_MOBS` comprising 23 fully articulated creature entries with complete stats, descriptions, AI broadcasts, attacks, and special rules:

- **Strict CarlRPG Mechanics Adherence**:
  - Stat modifiers strictly calculated using `getDCCStatModifier` (no D&D `(score-10)/2` math, no negative modifiers).
  - Health per bar precisely corresponds to CON modifier for every entity.
  - Attack checks for mobs roll `1d20 + modifiers` without false untrained disadvantage.
- **Mob Sheet & Presentation (`src/models/actors/mob-model.mjs`, `template.json`, `templates/actors/parts/page1-core.hbs`)**:
  - Added native `description` and `aiDescription` fields to `MobDataModel` and `template.json`.

## 2.0.17

### Mob Actor Type, Variable Health Bars & Sequential Token Placement

- **Mob Actor Type & Data Model (`src/models/actors/mob-model.mjs`, `template.json`, `system.json`)**:
  - Registered new `mob` actor type and `MobDataModel` extending `BaseActorDataModel`.
  - Added unique mob attributes: `system.attributes.treasure` (string description of loot/coins) and `system.attributes.xp` (defeat experience value).
  - Added mob details: `classification` ("Mob", "Elite", "Boss"), `creatureType` ("Animal", "Humanoid", etc.), `floor`, `location`, `notes`, `special`, and `source`.
  - Added combat difficulty attributes: `surpriseDifficulty` and `evadeDifficulty` (defaults to attacker target DC $10 + \text{DEX Mod} + \text{Floor Number}$, e.g. `12+F`).
- **Variable Health Bars Architecture (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/apps/combat-metrics.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented variable health bar slots on mobs (`hp.bars`, default 2), replacing the fixed 10-bar crawler constraint.
  - Health per bar (`hpPerBar`) defaults to the mob's CON modifier (`getDCCStatModifier(CON)`), with support for explicit overrides via `system.attributes.hp.hpPerBar`.
  - Derived $\text{Max HP} = \text{bars} \times \text{hpPerBar}$ in both `MobDataModel` and `DCCActor.prepareDerivedData`.
  - Updated `getHpPerBar(targetActor)` in `combat-metrics.mjs` to resolve mob variable bars and explicit `hpPerBar`, preserving strict CarlRPG bar-by-bar damage deduction and excess damage ignoring.
- **Independent Unlinked Tokens (`prototypeToken.actorLink: false`)**:
  - Configured `DCCActor._preCreate` and `prepareBaseData` to enforce `prototypeToken.actorLink: false` and hostile disposition (`-1`) for all mobs.
  - Placed and copy/pasted mob tokens operate as independent synthetic actors; mutations on one token (e.g. damage, conditions) do not alter the world actor or sister tokens.
- **Auto-Incrementing Sequential Token Naming (`src/dcc.mjs`)**:
  - Enhanced `preCreateToken` hook to automatically detect mob token placements and copy-pastes.
  - Strips trailing numbers from the base name and queries existing tokens on the target scene to sequentially number them (e.g. `Goblin` -> `Goblin 1`, `Goblin 2`; copying `Goblin 2` increments to `Goblin 3`).
- **Crawler Sheet Mob Integration (`src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `templates/actors/parts/page1-core.hbs`)**:
  - Exposes `isMob` context flag.
  - Custom mob header section rendering classification, level, creature type, floor, location, XP value, and treasure.
  - Dynamic health bar segment visualization generated from the mob's configured number of bars (e.g. 50% and 100% for 2 bars).
  - Dedicated Difficulties & Combat Values section displaying Evade Difficulty and Surprise Difficulty.
- **Canonical Example & Unit Test Suite (`tests/mobs.test.mjs`)**:
  - Full automated test suite verifying Pack Rat (Level 2 Mob, Page 32 Game Master's Campaign Toolkit): CON 3 (+2 CON mod), 2 bars of 2 HP (4 Max HP), Evade Difficulty `12+F`, Surprise Difficulty `11+F`, Bite attack (`1d20 + 3` to hit, `1d4+1` Piercing).
  - Verified bar-based damage deduction (3 damage removes 1 bar of 2 HP and ignores 1 excess damage, leaving 2 HP; 1 damage removes 0 bars).

## 2.0.15

### Attack Rolling from Skills Table & Interactive Chat Damage Execution

- **Skills Table Attack Rolling Integration (`src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `templates/actors/parts/page3-skills.hbs`)**:
  - Clicking the roll icon (`.roll-skill`) for an attack or combat skill on the Skills page (Page 3) now rolls **To Hit vs Target Evade** via `actor.rollAttack(item, 'hit')`, identically to attacks rolled from the first-page attacks table or the hotlist.
  - Automatically identifies attack skills based on damage capabilities (`hasDamage`), `checkType` containing "attack", attack types (`Edge`, `Bashing`, `Reach`, `Ranged`, `Strike`, `Hand to Hand`), or category `Combat`.
  - Non-attack utility skills continue to roll standard stat/skill checks via `actor.rollSkill(item)`.
  - Updated button tooltips dynamically: Attack skills display `Roll Attack (To Hit): 1d20 + Rank [X] + [Mod] vs Target Evade`, while utility skills display `Roll Skill Check: 1d20 + Total [X] | Modified Rank: [Y]`.
- **Chat Damage Roll Button & Dice Evaluation Fix (`src/documents/actor.mjs`, `src/dcc.mjs`)**:
  - Preserved Foundry VTT core dice roll rendering (`roll.render()`) when including interactive action buttons in message content, resolving an issue where only calculation flavor was shown without dice boxes.
  - Embedded `data-actor-id`, `data-item-id`, and `data-skill-id` attributes on chat card damage buttons.
  - Implemented event delegation handler for `.roll-skill-dmg-from-card, .roll-attack-dmg-from-card` in `onRenderChatMessage` (`renderChatMessageHTML` / `renderChatMessage`), enabling players to click the **[ 💥 Roll Attack Damage ]** button directly from the chat card to roll damage and post full typed damage cards with token target application.
  - Updated `getSkillDamageData` to accurately return `hasDamage: false` for non-combat utility skills lacking damage formulas or dice.
- **Automated Test Suite (`tests/skills-attack-roll.test.mjs`, `tests/setup.mjs`)**:
  - Added full test suite verifying skill classification, attack roll routing from the sheet, dice roll rendering, chat card button delegation, and damage card generation.
  - Enhanced headless test harness `MockRoll.prototype.evaluate` with `.render()` support mirroring Foundry VTT core.

## 2.0.14

### Official DCC RPG Rank Damage Die & Damage Rules Integration

- **Rank Damage Die Scaling Module (`src/data/rank-dice.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `getRankDamageDie(rank)` with full fidelity to the official DCC RPG scaling table:
    - **Rank 0**: +0 (Untrained Check with Disadvantage: `2d20kl + Stat Mod` vs Target Evade)
    - **Rank 1**: +1 flat damage bonus
    - **Ranks 2–3**: +1d2
    - **Ranks 4–5**: +1d4
    - **Ranks 6–7**: +1d6
    - **Ranks 8–9**: +1d8
    - **Ranks 10–13**: +1d10
    - **Ranks 14–15+**: +1d12
  - Added `parseUpgrades(upgrades)` supporting string, nested object, and dictionary schemas.
  - Implemented `getEvadeTargetDifficulty(foeDexMod, floorNumber)` computing $10 + \text{Foe DEX Mod} + \text{Floor Number}$.
- **Comprehensive Damage Calculations (`src/documents/actor.mjs`)**:
  - `getSkillDamageData(skillItem, options)`: Resolves base damage, rank upgrades, governing stat modifier, rank damage die, Hand-to-Hand damage effects (Pugilism + Iron Punch), and Fire Fingers Rank 15 passive melee bonus.
  - `getSpellDamageData(spellItem)`: Integrates rank damage die scaling, rank upgrades (+dice, multi-target, blast/line), Rank 15 base dice multiplier (e.g. Magic Missile $\times 3$ dice), and debuff tracking (Burned on 1+ HB loss).
  - `getAttackDamageParts(attackItem, options)`: Accurately associates weapon skills to weapons, adds matching Rank Damage Dice, and factors in Fire Fingers Rank 15 melee bonuses for natural/brawling strikes.
  - `rollSkillDamage(skillItem, options)`: Evaluates damage parts, applies multipliers, and generates interactive CarlRPG damage cards with targeted token damage application.
  - `rollSkill(skillItem)`: Embeds inline `Roll Attack Damage` buttons on skill check cards whenever the skill possesses damage formulas.
- **Character Sheet UI Integration (`src/sheets/crawler-sheet.mjs`, `templates/actors/parts/page3-skills.hbs`)**:
  - Extended Page 3 (Skills) with inline `.roll-skill-dmg` burst buttons displaying damage formula tooltips.
  - Added event listeners on crawler sheet controller to dispatch `actor.rollSkillDamage()` directly from the sheet.
- **Test Suite Updates (`tests/rank-damage-dice.test.mjs`, `tests/spell-actions.test.mjs`)**:
  - Added 81 automated unit tests in `tests/rank-damage-dice.test.mjs` verifying all milestones (R1, R2, R4, R5, R6, R8, R10, R14, R15, R16) across Fire Fingers, Fireball, Magic Missile, Unarmed Combat, Pugilism, Combined Pugilism + Iron Punch, Longsword, Fire Fingers R15 passive, Untrained disadvantage checks, and non-stacking rules.
  - Updated `tests/spell-actions.test.mjs` to reflect the Rank Damage Die in spell formulas.

## 2.0.13

### ApplicationV2 Options Initialization & `id.replace` Safety Fix

- **Fix ApplicationV2 Options Initialization (`src/apps/base-application.mjs`)**:
  - Resolved `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')` in `ApplicationV2` constructor when instantiating `DCCSessionManagerApp`, `DCCCrawlerCreatorApp`, `DCCCombatMetricsApp`, and other custom applications.
  - Subclasses defining legacy `defaultOptions` did not have own-property `DEFAULT_OPTIONS`, causing Foundry's `_initializeApplicationOptions` inheritance chain merge to omit their configuration and clobber `id` with `undefined`.
  - Implemented `_initializeApplicationOptions(options)` in `DCCBaseApplication` to dynamically pull `v1` default options from `this.constructor.defaultOptions`, map `id`, `classes`, `window.title`, `window.resizable`, and `position`, and ensure `initialized.id` is always a valid string before `ApplicationV2` executes `.replace('{id}', ...)`.
  - Defined `static DEFAULT_OPTIONS = { classes: ['dcc-app'] }` on `DCCBaseApplication` without `id: undefined`, preventing pollution of the inheritance chain defaults.
  - Added `appId` getter and `close()` cleanup to ensure backwards-compatible integration with `ui.windows`.
- **Test Suite Updates (`tests/setup.mjs`, `tests/v13-namespacing.test.mjs`)**:
  - Enhanced `MockApplicationV2` in `tests/setup.mjs` to faithfully mirror Foundry v12/v13's `_initializeApplicationOptions` inheritance chain traversal and `id.replace("{id}", uniqueId)`.
  - Added unit test suite in `tests/v13-namespacing.test.mjs` validating instantiation, valid string IDs, window options, override handling, and render/close lifecycle for all 7 DCC application classes.

## 2.0.12

### ApplicationV2 Migration & ActorDirectory Namespacing

- **ActorDirectory Global Namespacing Fix (`src/dcc.mjs`)**:
  - Replaced unsafe `(typeof ActorDirectory !== 'undefined' && app instanceof ActorDirectory)` in `getApplicationHeaderButtons` with safe resolution via `foundry.applications.sidebar.tabs.ActorDirectory`.
  - Completely eliminates the deprecation warning: `"Error: You are accessing the global 'ActorDirectory' which is now namespaced under foundry.applications.sidebar.tabs.ActorDirectory"`.
- **ApplicationV2 Framework Migration (`src/apps/base-application.mjs`)**:
  - Implemented `DCCBaseApplication` extending `foundry.applications.api.HandlebarsApplicationMixin(foundry.applications.api.ApplicationV2)` on Foundry v12+.
  - Migrated all 7 custom applications to extend `DCCBaseApplication`:
    - `DCCCombatMetricsApp` ([src/apps/combat-metrics.mjs](file:///Users/jeremy/Code/CarlRPG/src/apps/combat-metrics.mjs))
    - `DCCCombatArchiveApp` ([src/apps/combat-archive.mjs](file:///Users/jeremy/Code/CarlRPG/src/apps/combat-archive.mjs))
    - `DCCCrawlerCreatorApp` ([src/apps/crawler-creator.mjs](file:///Users/jeremy/Code/CarlRPG/src/apps/crawler-creator.mjs))
    - `DCCSessionManagerApp` ([src/apps/session-manager.mjs](file:///Users/jeremy/Code/CarlRPG/src/apps/session-manager.mjs))
    - `DCCSkillManager` ([src/apps/skill-manager.mjs](file:///Users/jeremy/Code/CarlRPG/src/apps/skill-manager.mjs))
    - `DCCSpellManager` ([src/apps/spell-manager.mjs](file:///Users/jeremy/Code/CarlRPG/src/apps/spell-manager.mjs))
    - `DCCBuffDebuffManager` ([src/apps/buff-manager.mjs](file:///Users/jeremy/Code/CarlRPG/src/apps/buff-manager.mjs))
  - Implemented automatic translation bridges in `DCCBaseApplication` so `defaultOptions` -> `DEFAULT_OPTIONS`/`PARTS`, `getData()` -> `_prepareContext()`, and `activateListeners()` -> `_onRender()` work seamlessly without changing application business logic.
  - Completely eliminates the deprecation warning: `"The V1 Application framework is deprecated, and will be removed in a later core software version. Please use the V2 version of the Application framework available under foundry.applications.api.ApplicationV2."`.
- **Automated Testing**:
  - Updated `tests/v13-namespacing.test.mjs` verifying that all application classes inherit from `foundry.applications.api.ApplicationV2`.
  - Added unit tests asserting that neither the deprecated `ActorDirectory` getter nor the deprecated V1 `Application` constructor is invoked during application lifecycle.

## 2.0.11

### Chat Message Rendering Hook Early Module Detection (`renderChatMessageHTML`)

- **Early Module Load Version Detection (`isFoundryV13Plus`)**:
  - Fixed an issue where version checks during initial script/module evaluation returned `false` because `globalThis.game` is not yet instantiated when ES modules first load.
  - Implemented `isFoundryV13Plus()` checking `game.release`, `foundry.release`, `CONST.BUILD_RELEASE`, `CONST.VERSION`, and architectural markers like `foundry.appv1` and `foundry.applications.sidebar.tabs.CombatTracker`.
  - Added hook cleanup via `Hooks.off('renderChatMessage', onRenderChatMessage)` whenever running on v13+ to guarantee no legacy hook listeners remain registered.
  - Re-invoked `registerChatMessageHook()` inside `Hooks.once('init')` to verify registration once `game` is initialized.
  - Completely eliminates the deprecation warning: `"Error: The renderChatMessage hook is deprecated. Please use renderChatMessageHTML instead, which now passes an HTMLElement argument instead of jQuery."`.
- **Automated Testing**:
  - Added unit test in `tests/chat-message-hook.test.mjs` verifying that `registerChatMessageHook()` accurately identifies Foundry v13 and binds `renderChatMessageHTML` even when `globalThis.game` is completely undefined.

## 2.0.10

### CombatTracker v13 Namespacing (`foundry.applications.sidebar.tabs.CombatTracker`)

- **CombatTracker Base Resolution**:
  - Updated `DCCCombatTracker` ([src/apps/combat-tracker.mjs](file:///Users/jeremy/Code/CarlRPG/src/apps/combat-tracker.mjs)) to check `foundry.applications.sidebar.tabs.CombatTracker` first.
  - In Foundry v13, sidebar tabs were moved under the Application V2 namespace `foundry.applications.sidebar.tabs.*` (unlike V1 sheets which moved to `foundry.appv1.sheets.*`).
  - Eliminates the deprecation warning: `"You are accessing the global 'CombatTracker' which is now namespaced under foundry.applications.sidebar.tabs.CombatTracker"`.
- **Automated Testing**:
  - Updated `tests/v13-namespacing.test.mjs` and `tests/setup.mjs` to verify `DCCCombatTracker` inherits from `foundry.applications.sidebar.tabs.CombatTracker` without accessing deprecated `globalThis.CombatTracker`.

## 2.0.9

### Foundry v13 Global Namespace Migration & Deprecation Cleanup

- **Sheet & Tracker Base Class Namespacing**:
  - Migrated `DCCCrawlerSheet` to extend `foundry.appv1.sheets.ActorSheet` (with fallback to `globalThis.ActorSheet`).
  - Migrated `DCCItemSheet` to extend `foundry.appv1.sheets.ItemSheet` (with fallback to `globalThis.ItemSheet`).
  - Migrated `DCCCombatTracker` to extend `foundry.appv1.sidebar.tabs.CombatTracker` (with fallback to `globalThis.CombatTracker`).
  - Completely eliminates Foundry v13 deprecation warnings:
    - `"Error: You are accessing the global 'ActorSheet' which is now namespaced under foundry.appv1.sheets.ActorSheet"`
    - `"Error: You are accessing the global 'ItemSheet' which is now namespaced under foundry.appv1.sheets.ItemSheet"`
    - `"Error: You are accessing the global 'CombatTracker' which is now namespaced under foundry.appv1.sidebar.tabs.CombatTracker"`
- **Document Collection & Template Loading Namespacing (`src/dcc.mjs`)**:
  - Sheet unregistration and registration now resolve `Actors` from `foundry.documents.collections.Actors` and `Items` from `foundry.documents.collections.Items`.
  - Handlebars template preloading resolves `foundry.applications.handlebars.loadTemplates` (with fallbacks to `foundry.utils.loadTemplates` and `loadTemplates`).
  - Eliminates v13 deprecation warnings for `Actors`, `Items`, and `loadTemplates`.
- **Application & Dialog Class Namespacing**:
  - Updated custom applications (`DCCCrawlerCreatorApp`, `DCCSessionManagerApp`, `DCCCombatArchiveApp`, `DCCSkillManager`, `DCCSpellManager`, `DCCBuffDebuffManager`, `DCCCombatMetricsApp`) to extend `foundry.appv1.applications.Application`.
  - Updated interactive prompts and confirmation dialogs across all managers to resolve `foundry.appv1.applications.Dialog`.
- **Combat Base Document Resolution (`src/documents/combat.mjs`)**:
  - Updated `BaseCombat` to check `CONFIG.Combat.documentClass` and `foundry.documents.BaseCombat` before falling back to `Combat`.
- **Automated Testing**:
  - Added dedicated test suite `tests/v13-namespacing.test.mjs` verifying class hierarchy under `foundry.appv1`, namespaced collection lookups, and the absence of deprecated global property accesses in v13 environments.

## 2.0.8

### Sidebar Directory Hooks & Foundry v13 HTMLElement Normalization

- **Items Directory Hook Fix (`renderItemDirectory`)**:
  - Normalized `html` argument via `$(html ?? app?.element)` instead of directly calling `html.find()`.
  - Fixed `TypeError: html.find is not a function` occurring in Foundry v13 when sidebar directories pass native `HTMLElement` instances.
- **Unified Sidebar Directory Injection**:
  - Refactored `injectItemDirectoryButtons` and `injectActorDirectoryButtons` to safely handle both `HTMLElement` and jQuery instances across `renderItemDirectory`, `renderActorDirectory`, `renderSidebarTab`, and `renderCombatTracker`.
  - Added support in `renderSidebarTab` for dynamically injecting the Skill Library & Manager button when switching to the `items` tab.
- **Automated Testing**:
  - Added `tests/sidebar-hooks.test.mjs` verifying that `renderItemDirectory`, `renderActorDirectory`, `renderSidebarTab`, and `renderCombatTracker` handle native `HTMLElement` arguments without errors.

## 2.0.7

### Chat Message Rendering Hook & Foundry v13+ Migration

- **Foundry v13+ Compatibility (`renderChatMessageHTML`)**:
  - Migrated chat message rendering from the deprecated `renderChatMessage` hook to `renderChatMessageHTML` on Foundry v13+.
  - Fully eliminates the deprecation warning: `"Error: The renderChatMessage hook is deprecated. Please use renderChatMessageHTML instead, which now passes an HTMLElement argument instead of jQuery."`
  - Maintains automatic backwards compatibility with Foundry v12 by dynamically registering `renderChatMessage` when running on v12.
- **Modern DOM Event Handling (`onRenderChatMessage`)**:
  - Rewrote the chat message action handler (`src/dcc.mjs`) to work natively with `HTMLElement` instances using standard DOM APIs (`querySelectorAll`, `closest`, `dataset`, `addEventListener`, `insertAdjacentHTML`).
  - Added safe fallbacks for jQuery wrappers when running on older Foundry versions or test environments.
  - Ensured event listener idempotent binding via `dataset.dccBound` to prevent duplicate click handling.
- **Test Suite**:
  - Added dedicated test suite `tests/chat-message-hook.test.mjs` verifying hook registration across Foundry v12 and v13 environments, unbinding logic, `HTMLElement` click execution, and backwards-compatible jQuery handling.

## 2.0.6

### Rollable Tables Schema Validation & Directory Registration Fix

- **RollTable & TableResult Schema Compliance (`src/data/background-tables.mjs`)**:
  - **Fixed TableResult Type Resolution**: Corrected `CONST.TABLE_RESULT_TYPES.TEXT` evaluation (`0`), which previously failed a truthy check and defaulted to `1` (`DOCUMENT`), causing Foundry's `TableResultData` DataModel to throw validation errors due to missing `documentCollection`.
  - **Omitted Invalid Manual Result IDs**: Removed custom non-conforming IDs (such as `respastTrauma1`) on embedded `TableResult` objects so Foundry's `DocumentIdField` automatically assigns valid 16-character alphanumeric IDs.
  - **Explicit Document Reference Fields**: Set `documentCollection: null`, `documentId: null`, and standard SVG icons (`icons/svg/d20-grey.svg` for table, `icons/svg/d20-black.svg` for results).
  - **Empty Table Result Recovery**: If world tables already exist from an earlier boot without results, `ensureBackgroundTables()` automatically backfills their 12 table results via `createEmbeddedDocuments`.
  - **GM Creation Guard**: Added explicit GM user check in `ensureBackgroundTables()` to prevent non-GM players from throwing permission errors on world document creation during world load.
- **Testing & Test Harness**:
  - Updated `tests/setup.mjs` to define `CONST.TABLE_RESULT_TYPES` and enforce strict schema validation in `MockRollTable.create`.
  - Added unit tests in `tests/background-tables.test.mjs` verifying schema validity, result backfilling, and GM permissions.

## 2.0.5

### Step 9 Background Rollable Tables & Character Creator Integration

- **Crawler Background Rollable Tables Dataset (`src/data/background-tables.mjs`)**:
  - Added official rollable tables matching Step 9 of Crawler Character Creation:
    - **Table 11: Past Traumas (1d12)**: 12 entries defining hardships, losses, and psychological wounds.
    - **Table 12: Loose Ends (1d12)**: 12 entries detailing unresolved surface-world business and obligations.
    - **Table 13: Regrets (1d12)**: 12 entries capturing personal remorse and past missteps.
  - Implemented `rollBackgroundTable(key, options)` supporting evaluated 1d12 dice rolls and explicit choice lookups.
  - Implemented `createBackgroundRollTableData(key)` generating standard Foundry VTT `RollTable` document data schemas.
  - Implemented `ensureBackgroundTables()` to automatically initialize official Rollable Tables in Foundry's `game.tables` directory on world startup (`Hooks.once('ready')`).
  - Registered tables under `CONFIG.DCC.backgroundTables`, `game.dcc.backgroundTables`, and `window.carl.backgroundTables`.

- **Character Creator Terminal Integration (`DCCCrawlerCreatorApp`)**:
  - Added dedicated **Step 9: Psychological Background & Story Matrices** section to the character creation terminal.
  - Interactive trait cards for Past Trauma, Loose Ends, and Regrets with:
    - Dedicated `[ 🎲 Roll 1d12 ]` buttons for each table.
    - Dropdown selectors allowing direct choice from all 12 entries per table.
    - Multi-line editable textareas allowing players to tweak rolled text or write custom backstories.
    - Top-level `[ 🎲 Roll All 3 Tables ]` action button to roll all traits simultaneously.
  - Integrated with the procedural randomizer (`[ 🎲 Randomize All ]`) and reset functionality.
  - Persists `pastTrauma`, `looseEnds`, and `regrets` directly into `actor.system.details` upon creation.

- **Character Sheet Manual Editability & Creative Freedom (`DCCCrawlerSheet`)**:
  - Enhanced Page 2 (Gear & Story) Past Trauma, Loose Ends, and Regrets story boxes with inline `[ 🎲 Roll 1d12 ]` buttons in their headers.
  - Rolling from the sheet posts an interactive chat card with the roll total and story quote, non-destructively updating or appending to the field.
  - Story textareas remain standard, fully editable form inputs (`system.details.pastTrauma`, `looseEnds`, `regrets`), guaranteeing full creative freedom for players.

## 2.0.4

### Sheet & Application Window Rendering Fix

- **Resolved Read-Only Getter Collision on Sheet & Application Instances**:
  - Fixed an issue where `DCCCrawlerSheet` failed to open due to assignments to read-only getters (`this.actor`, `this.document`) inherited from Foundry's `ActorSheet` and `DocumentSheet`.
  - Fixed an issue where `DCCItemSheet` failed to open due to assignments to read-only getters (`this.item`, `this.document`) inherited from Foundry's `ItemSheet` and `DocumentSheet`.
  - Fixed an issue where `DCCSessionManagerApp` failed to open due to setting `this.rendered = false / true`, which collided with Foundry's native `Application.prototype.rendered` getter without a setter.
- **Foundry Native Lifecycle Integration**:
  - Fully delegated window lifecycle management (`this.rendered`, `ui.windows`) to Foundry's core `Application` system.
  - Retained real-time `Hooks.on('dccSessionUpdated')` subscriber using the native `this.rendered` getter check.
- **Test Harness Parity**:
  - Updated `tests/setup.mjs` to faithfully mirror Foundry VTT prototype getters for `actor`, `item`, `document`, and `rendered`.
  - Added dedicated test suite `tests/sheet-rendering.test.mjs` preventing any future regressions on sheet or app initialization and rendering.

## 2.0.3

### Party Progression & Session Manager — Customized Event Dialog & Real-Time Live Updates

- **Customized Add Event Dialog (`promptAddEventDialog`)**:
  - Replaced immediate default manual event generation with an interactive modal dialog powered by `templates/apps/add-event-dialog.hbs` (with programmatic fallback `DCCSessionManagerApp.getAddEventDialogHtml`).
  - Contains all parameters supported by the search and filter suite:
    - **Crawler selection**: choose any world crawler to associate the event with.
    - **Action / Event Type**: Trained Skill, Untrained Skill Attempt, Attack / Strike, Spell Cast, AI Favor Adjustment, Popularity Shift, Damage Dealt, Damage Taken, Loot Box Awarded, Stat Check, and Manual / Custom Event.
    - **Event Name**: custom label / descriptor.
    - **Untrained Attempt flag**: checkbox flagging attempts for end-of-session promotion review.
    - **Formula, Total & d20 Face**: explicit roll details and natural die result.
    - **Target DC / AC**: numeric challenge threshold.
    - **7-Tier Outcome**: choice between Auto-Calculate and explicit override (Critical Failure, Major Failure, Failure, Near Miss, Success, Major Success, Critical Success, Pending DC).
    - **Stat / Resource Delta**: +/- modifiers for AI Favor, Popularity, and Damage.
    - **Notes / Description**: freeform notes for GM tracking.
  - Automatically resets/aligns active search filters upon submission so newly added events are immediately visible in the active table.

- **Real-Time Live Event Synchronization**:
  - Live window refresh for open `DCCSessionManagerApp` instances via robust `ui.windows` tracking and `dccSessionUpdated` hook broadcasts.
  - Fixed session reference detachment in `DCCSessionEngine` to guarantee changes persist cleanly.
  - Wired `DCCActor.rollStat` and `DCCActor.rollEvade` to automatically log checks to the active session ledger in real time.
  - Wired `DCCCombatMetrics.applyDamageToTarget` so all damage (in or out of combat) logs directly to the active session ledger with damage dealt/taken entries.
  - Pushed damage dealt, damage taken, and loot box dispatch directly to `session.ledger`.
  - Added unit test suite covering full manual event customization and real-time live updates across multiple open windows.

## 2.0.1

### System Data Models & Application V2 Architecture (Phases 1, 2 & 3: Foundry V16 Preparation)

- **Application V2 Forward-Compatible Sheet Architecture (Phase 3)**:
  - Modernized `DCCCrawlerSheet` and `DCCItemSheet` with Application V2 paradigms (`DEFAULT_OPTIONS`, `PARTS`, `_prepareContext(options)`, `_onRender(context, options)`), while retaining base inheritance from `ActorSheet` and `ItemSheet` for native stability in Foundry V12 where `Actors.registerSheet` and `Items.registerSheet` require standard document sheet controllers.
  - Defined static `DEFAULT_OPTIONS` specifying semantic tags, position dimensions, form handlers, and header window controls (direct "Save to PDF" AcroForm export).
  - Defined static `PARTS` mapping Handlebars templates (`systems/carl-rpg/templates/actors/crawler-sheet.hbs` and `systems/carl-rpg/templates/items/item-sheet.hbs`).
  - Implemented Application V2 `_prepareContext(options)` and `_onRender(context, options)` lifecycle methods.
  - Provided dual compatibility: supports both Application V2 calling conventions (`new DCCCrawlerSheet({ document: actor })`, `_prepareContext()`) and legacy FormApplication v1 conventions (`new DCCCrawlerSheet(actor)`, `getData()`, `_getHeaderButtons()`).
  - Exposed `game.dcc.applications` namespace grouping all system sheets and manager apps.
  - Added dedicated test suite `tests/application-v2-sheets.test.mjs` with 6 unit tests covering options, parts, dual constructors, context compilation, prototype inheritance, and render hooks.

- **System Data Models for All Actor Types (Phase 2)**:
  - Implemented typed `foundry.abstract.TypeDataModel` classes for all 4 canonical Actor subtypes in `src/models/actors/`:
    - `BaseActorDataModel`: Shared core class defining standard schemas for the 5 abilities (`str`, `int`, `con`, `dex`, `cha`) and base attributes (`hp`, `mana`, `evade`, `dr`, `speed`, `aiFavor`, `size`, `externalBuffs`). Encapsulates shared derived calculation methods (`prepareDerivedBaseStats()`) for size normalization, equipped gear stat/DR/evade bonuses, external buff resolutions, debuff penalties, DCC stat modifier lookups, and attribute totals.
    - `CrawlerDataModel`: Full schema for Player Characters (Crawlers) including `details` (`floor`, `race`, `class`, `level`, `xp`, `personalSpace`, etc.), `gearSlots`, and `hotlist`. Implements `prepareDerivedData()` handling skill cascading bonuses across weapon groups, generic type bonuses, and experience progression thresholds.
    - `PetDataModel`: Companion/pet model with level, attacks, and CON-derived durability.
    - `MountVehicleDataModel`: Structural durability model for mounts and vehicles with size normalization, speed, and DR.
    - `NPCDataModel`: Monster/NPC model with level, defeat XP values, notes, and special traits.
  - Registered all Actor Data Models under `CONFIG.Actor.dataModels` and exposed via `game.dcc.models`.
  - Configured `CONFIG.Actor.trackableAttributes` across all 4 actor types for token bar and status tracking.
  - Updated `DCCActor.prepareDerivedData()` and `prepareBaseData()` to delegate directly to `this.system.prepareDerivedData()` and `prepareBaseData()`.
  - Added dedicated test suite `tests/actor-data-models.test.mjs` with 11 unit tests covering all actor types, derived calculations, cascading weapon groups, and document class actions.

- **System Data Models for All Item Types (Phase 1)**:
  - Implemented typed `foundry.abstract.TypeDataModel` classes for all 11 canonical Item subtypes in `src/models/items/`:
    - `SkillDataModel`: Declarative schema for skill ranks, stat governing bonuses, damage modifiers, and computed `totalRank` getter.
    - `AttackDataModel`: Combat to-hit stats, ranks, dice formulas, damage stats, and structured `damageParts`.
    - `SpellDataModel`: Mana costs, range, duration, cooldowns, spell types, quotes, descriptions, and upgrade tiers (`rank5`, `rank10`, `rank15`).
    - `GearDataModel`: Equipment slots, quantities, equipped state, DR/Evade bonuses, and nested `abilityModifiers`.
    - `BuffDataModel`: Buff types, stat/damage multipliers, damage types, and duration tracking.
    - `DebuffDataModel`: Severity tiers, damage reductions, rounding behaviors, and duration tracking.
    - `LootDataModel`: Item quantities and descriptions.
    - `RaceDataModel`, `ClassDataModel`, `DeityDataModel`, `SponsorDataModel`: Structured lore models with HTML-sanitized fields.
  - Registered all Item Data Models under `CONFIG.Item.dataModels` and exposed via `game.dcc.models`.
- **System Manifest Modernization**:
  - Added explicit `documentTypes` definition in `system.json` for all 4 Actor types and 11 Item types.
  - Configured automated HTML sanitization paths (`htmlFields`) to safeguard rich-text fields.
  - Bumped maximum verified compatibility to Foundry V16.
- **Test Harness Integration**:
  - Enhanced headless Node.js test harness in `tests/setup.mjs` with lightweight implementations of `foundry.abstract.DataModel`, `TypeDataModel`, and `foundry.data.fields.*`.
  - Added test suites `tests/item-data-models.test.mjs` and `tests/actor-data-models.test.mjs` verifying schema defaults, validation, serialization, and document binding.

## 1.0.28

### Visual Readability & Contrast Enhancements

- **Page 1 Core Ability Sublabel Readability**:
  - Replaced low-contrast `#555` stat sublabels with crisp `#111111` typography (`'Oswald'`, 10px, bold 700, 0.5px letter-spacing).
  - Added dedicated high-contrast classes `.dcc-stat-enhanced-label` (DCC theme red `#c0392b`, 700) and `.dcc-stat-unenhanced-label` (deep black `#111111`, 700) across all 5 ability score cards on Page 1.
  - Increased contrast on stat divider slashes from `#555` to `#111111`.
- **Character Sheet PDF Export Polish**:
  - Appended known spells directly to the Page 3 Skills table with rank, governing stat modifier, spell type, MP cost, and formatted effects/damage.
  - Calibrated Page 1 Health Bar slots to uniformly display crawler CON modifier with clean, unchecked boxes for tabletop play.

## 1.0.27

### Fillable Character Sheet PDF Export

- **Official 6-Page PDF Character Sheet Integration**:
  - Added direct export of Crawler character sheets to the official 6-page fillable character sheet PDF (`assets/sheet/fillable_character_sheet.pdf`).
  - Seamlessly maps all 429 AcroForm fields across all six pages:
    - **Page 1: Core**: Name, Race, Gender, Level, Crawler Number, Class, Floor, Ability Scores (Enhanced, Unenhanced, Modifiers), calibrated Health Bar (10 boxes displaying crawler CON modifier, blank checkboxes ready for play), Evade & Damage Resistance totals, Mana, Debuffs, External Buffs (automatically resolved into clean human-readable descriptions instead of internal hashes), and up to 5 Attacks.
    - **Page 2: Hotlist & Gear**: 10 Hotlist slots with damage/mana cost labels, equipped Gear slots (Head, Torso, Arms, Hands, Legs, Feet, Accessories), Popularity, Past Trauma, Loose Ends, Regrets, and Notes.
    - **Page 3: Skills & Known Spells**: Up to 20 rows with Name, Rank, Governing Stat & Modifier, Check Type / Spell MP Cost, Description/Notes (including damage, range, and effects for spells), and Trained checkboxes. Known spells are automatically appended directly to the skills list.
    - **Page 4: Inventory**: Up to 20 inventory items with Item Name, Quantity, and Description.
    - **Page 5: Extras & Space**: Pet attributes, levels, and attacks, Mount/Vehicle stats, Important Things I've Killed (13 lines), Clubs & Societies (6 lines), Personal Space (Tier, Size, Amenities over 11 lines), and Deity details.
    - **Page 6: Abilities & Sponsors**: Racial Abilities (22 lines), Class Abilities (22 lines), and Sponsor cards (up to 3 sponsors).
- **Sheet Integration & One-Click Download**:
  - Added a "Save to PDF" header button (`save-pdf-btn`) in `DCCCrawlerSheet._getHeaderButtons()` for quick window-level access.
  - Added a stylized "Save to PDF" action button in the Page 1 Core header box (`.dcc-btn-save-pdf`).
  - Triggers automatic download of `<Crawler_Name>_CharacterSheet.pdf` in browser/Foundry client.
- **Embedded Zero-Dependency PDF Engine**:
  - Bundled minified `pdf-lib.min.js` in `lib/` and registered in `system.json` under `"scripts"`, with an ES module wrapper `lib/pdf-lib.mjs` for seamless headless Node.js testing and client-side execution.
- **Automated Test Suite**:
  - Added comprehensive unit tests in `tests/pdf-export.test.mjs` verifying document structure, complete field mapping across all 6 pages, and sheet controller integration.

## 1.0.25

### System Macros Compendium & Initial Hotbar Quick-Access

- **Universal Macros Compendium (`carl-rpg.macros`)**:
  - Registered official `macros` compendium pack in `system.json` under `packs/macros` configured with `PLAYER: "OBSERVER"` permissions, ensuring macros are accessible and executable by all players and non-administrators.
  - Added prebuilt LevelDB compendium database with three canonical system macros:
    1. **Character Creator**: Launches the Fast Matrix character creation terminal (`window.carl.openCrawlerCreator()`).
    2. **Open Combat Metrics**: Opens the real-time combat performance tracker and AI Award console (`window.carl.openCombatMetrics()`).
    3. **Party Progression and Session Hub**: Opens the party dashboard, activity ledger, and end-of-session management hub (`window.carl.openSessionManager()`).
- **Player-Executable Ownership**:
  - Defined explicit default ownership (`ownership: { default: 2 }`, OBSERVER) on all system macro records in `src/data/macros.mjs`, granting non-admin players permission to view and execute the macros from the compendium, directory, or macro bar.
- **Initial Macro Bar Auto-Configuration (`setupInitialHotbar`)**:
  - Automatically maps the three system macros into Hotbar slots **1**, **2**, and **3** upon user login:
    - **Slot 1**: Character Creator
    - **Slot 2**: Open Combat Metrics
    - **Slot 3**: Party Progression and Session Hub
  - Intelligently respects existing user keybindings without overwriting custom macro assignments, while providing a force option (`window.carl.setupInitialHotbar(game.user, { force: true })`) to restore system defaults.
  - Automatically ensures all three macros exist in the world `game.macros` collection with proper player observer permissions on world startup.
- **Automated Test Suite**:
  - Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/macros.test.mjs` verifying manifest compendium configuration, ownership permissions, LevelDB pack integrity, execution callbacks, non-admin access, and initial hotbar slot assignment.

## 1.0.24

### Character Creation Health & Mana Initialization

- **Dynamic Starting Health**:
  - Automatically calculates maximum health on character creation based on the assigned Constitution score:
    $$\text{Max HP} = 10 \times \text{getDCCStatModifier}(\text{CON})$$
  - Current health (`system.attributes.hp.value`) and maximum health (`system.attributes.hp.max`) are now initialized to the exact same value upon crawler creation, with `system.attributes.hp.pct` set to 100%.
  - Eliminates the previous static hardcoded default of 40 HP from `template.json`.
- **Dynamic Starting Mana**:
  - Automatically calculates maximum mana on character creation based on the assigned Intelligence score:
    $$\text{Max Mana} = \text{INT}$$
  - Current mana (`system.attributes.mana.value`) and maximum mana (`system.attributes.mana.max`) are now initialized to the exact same value upon crawler creation, with `system.attributes.mana.pct` set to 100%.
  - Eliminates the previous static hardcoded default of 10 Mana from `template.json`.
- **Induction Terminal Live Preview**:
  - Exposed live `startingHp` and `startingMana` metrics in `DCCCrawlerCreatorApp.getData()`.
  - Added visual `[HP: X / X]` and `[Mana: Y / Y]` summary pills in the Induction Terminal loadout box so players see their exact starting vitals as they allocate stats.
- **Actor Creation Lifecycle Fallback**:

- **Automated Test Suite**:
  - Added unit tests in `tests/crawler-creator.test.mjs` and `tests/starter-loadouts.test.mjs` verifying that diverse stat arrays (e.g., standard array, high INT/low CON, CON 4/INT 5) produce equal current and max health/mana values at creation time.

## 1.0.23

### Starter Weapon Inventory Equipping & Attack Item Generation

- **Starter Weapon Inventory Equipping**:
  - When choosing a starter weapon on character creation (`starterMode === 'weapon'`), the selected weapon is now automatically added to the crawler's inventory as a `gear` item.
  - Automatically equipped to the `hands` slot (`system.slot = 'hands'`, `system.equipped = true`).
  - Appears in Inventory under Gear with the red `EQUIPPED` badge, and is displayed under Hands/Holding in the equipped gear overview on Page 2.
- **Configured Attack Item**:
  - Automatically creates a matching `attack` item configured with the weapon's canonical parameters: to-hit stat (`str` or `dex`), to-hit rank (Rank 3), damage dice, damage stat, damage type, and combat notes.
  - Displayed on Page 1 (Core) in the ATTACKS table with one-click to-hit and damage rolling buttons.
  - Automatically mapped into Hotlist Slot 2 for quick combat access (with Heal on Slot 1).
- **Weapon Definitions Library (`DCC_STARTER_WEAPON_DEFINITIONS`)**:
  - Defined full combat profiles for all 18 starter weapons in `src/data/crawler-creation.mjs` including `toHitStat`, `damageDice`, `damageStat`, `damageType`, and weapon properties.

## 1.0.22

### Heal Spell Active Mechanics & Self-Targeting

- **Active Self Healing**:
  - Casting the `Heal` spell (`actor.rollSpell(healItem)`) dynamically evaluates the caster's Constitution modifier to determine health per bar (`CON Mod` HP per bar, 10 bars total).
  - Actively heals **up to 2 bars of health** (`2 × CON Mod` HP).
  - Target is strictly **self only** (the caster), ignoring any external canvas/token selections.
  - Automatically caps at the actor's maximum health (`system.attributes.hp.max`), preventing overhealing.
  - Updates actor `system.attributes.hp.value` and `system.attributes.hp.pct` in a clean atomic state change.
  - Displays rich healing feedback in the chat card (HP healed, Health Bar slots, HP/bar, current/max HP, and self target badge).
  - Logs heal action and recovered HP to the session manager activity ledger.
- **Automated Test Suite**:
  - Added unit tests 8 through 11 in `tests/starter-loadouts.test.mjs` verifying healing calculations, 2-bar recovery, max HP capping, full health casting, and mana requirement checks.
